<h1>Inter-process communication between SSSD processes<a class="headerlink" href="#inter-process-communication-between-sssd-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document describes how the different SSSD processes communicate
between one another with a special epmhasis on the Sbus protocol. In
addition, the document describes the interfaces SSSD might use to
communicate with external libraries or programs, such as libkrb5 or how
are the requests from NSS and PAM modules received.</p>
<div class="section" id="an-overview-of-the-sssd-architecture">
<h2>An overview of the SSSD architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-of-the-sssd-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD consists of several processes, each of them has its own
function. The SSSD processes can be one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the <em>monitor</em> - The purpose of the monitor process is to spawn the
other processes, periodically ping them if to check if they are still
running and respawn them if not. There is only one instance of the
monitor process at a given time.</li>
<li>a <em>data provider</em> - The data provider process communicates with the
remote server (i.e. queries the remote server for a user) and updates
the cache (i.e. writes the user entry. There is one Data Provider
process per remote server.</li>
<li>a <em>responder</em> - The system libraries (such as the Name Service Switch
module or the PAM module) communicate with the corresponding
responder process. When the responder process receives a query, it
checks the cache first and attempts to return the requested data from
cache. If the data is not cached (or is expired), the responder sends
a message to the Data Provider requesting the cache to be updated.
When the Data Provider is done updating the cache, the responder
process checks the cache again and returns the updated data. It is
important to note that the responder process never returns the data
directly from the server, the data is always written to the cache by
the Data Provider Process and returned to the calling library in the
responder process.</li>
<li>a <em>helper process</em> - The SSSD performs some operations that would be
blocking, such as kinit in a special helper sub-process. The
sub-processes are forked from the Data Provider processes again for
each operation, there is no preforked pool of helper processes. The
SSSD establishes pipes towards the processes&#8217; standard input and
output to communicate with the child using an ad-hoc wire protocol.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dbus-and-sbus">
<h2>DBus and SBUS<a class="headerlink" href="#dbus-and-sbus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD uses the DBus protocol to pass messages between the SSSD
processes. It should be noted that the core SSSD does NOT listen on or
use the system bus. The SSSD only uses the DBus protocol to pass
messages between the processes. There is a public SSSD DBus interface,
starting with the 1.12 upstream release, but that resides in a separate
sub-package and is not related to the interprocess communication between
the different components.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-quick-overview-of-the-dbus-concepts">
<h3>A quick overview of the DBus concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#a-quick-overview-of-the-dbus-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The DBus protocol consists of several primary components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <em>D-BUS Server</em> - Rather than accepting connections and listening
for requests on that connection, the D-BUS server is instead used
only for establishing connections. A DBus server is identified by its
address. Server addresses consist of a transport name followed by a
colon, and then an optional, comma-separated list of keys and values
in the form key=value, for example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unix:path=/tmp/dbus-test</span></code>.</li>
<li>The <em>D-BUS Connection</em> - Once a D-BUS connection has been made to a
D-BUS server, it becomes a peer-to-peer connection. Either end of the
connection can listen for method calls or signals, and either end can
initiate them.</li>
<li>The <em>D-BUS Message</em> - D-BUS messages come in three primary forms.
These are D-BUS method calls, D-BUS Signals and D-BUS errors. D-BUS
signals and D-BUS errors are one-way messages from one end of a D-BUS
connection to the other, intended to carry a brief message (such as a
signal to start or stop a service, or a notification that an error
has occurred in the connection). D-BUS errors are usually generated
by the internal D-BUS API itself, though they can be generated by
your own code as well. D-BUS method calls are the bread-and-butter of
the D-BUS protocol. The purpose of these calls is to essentially run
a method on a remote process and treat it as if it had been run
locally. These calls may (or may not) receive replies from the other
end of the connection.</li>
<li>The <em>D-BUS System Bus</em> - The system bus is a special implementation
of the D-BUS protocol. It was designed by the freedesktop project to
handle communication between the many system daemons. We DO NOT use
the system bus in the SSSD.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dbus-and-s-bus">
<h3>DBus and S-Bus<a class="headerlink" href="#dbus-and-s-bus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For performance reasons, the SSSD works in a completely non-blocking way
using the tevent event loop library from the Samba project. To integrate
the DBus API with the event loop and provide a level of abstraction, the
SSSD uses a wrapper around the D-Bus library called the S-Bus. The S-Bus
code can be found in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/sbus">​src/sbus</a>
subdirectory. In particular, the wrappers and tevent integration can be
found in
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/sbus/sssd_dbus_common.c">​sssd_dbus_common.c</a>
and
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/sbus/sssd_dbus_connection.c">​sssd_dbus_connection.c</a>
files. When the message is received, the tevent loop invokes the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sbus_message_handler</span></code> function which is located in
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/sbus/sssd_dbus_connection.c">​sssd_dbus_connection.c</a>.
The handler selects the SSSD internal interface that receives the
message and invokes the appropriate handler.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="describing-the-sbus-and-public-dbus-interfaces">
<h3>Describing the SBUS and public DBus interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#describing-the-sbus-and-public-dbus-interfaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting with upstream version 1.12, when the SSSD implemented its
public DBus interface, the SSSD switched from hardcoding interface
names, methods etc in the source files directly to only describing the
interfaces in XML files using the <a class="reference external" href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#introspection-format">​introspection
format</a>,
which are then used to autogenerate message handlers, property getters
and similar. While using generated code might sound odd at first, using
a code generator removes a large amount of code duplication, packing and
unpacking from DBus types to C types or vice versa, or unpacking DBus
message properties (if needed).</p>
<p>The code generator and the generated code are currently used for both
the DBus public interface (which is outside the scope of this page) and
the internal SBUS communication. The internal SBUS code, however, uses
the generated code in a &#8216;raw&#8217; mode mostly and still does
packing/unpacking of the parameters on its own. The reason is that the
&#8216;raw&#8217; code in SSSD predates the code generator, is quite stable and
tested and converting it to the easier handlers with unpacked parameters
might cause functional regressions.</p>
<p>One example of the canonical XML code might be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/tests/sbus_codegen_tests.xml">​unit
tests</a>,
along with the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/tests/sbus_codegen_tests_generated.c">​corresponding autogenerated
code</a>.
The XML files for the internal interfaces, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/providers/data_provider_iface.xml">​Data
Provider</a>
can also be inspected. Since all the internal interfaces use the raw
approach, the autogenerated code is <a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/providers/data_provider_iface_generated.c">​quite
terse</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/providers/data_provider_be.c">​interface
handlers</a>
do the packing and unpacking on their own.</p>

<div class="section" id="an-sbus-server">
<h3>An SBus server<a class="headerlink" href="#an-sbus-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An S-Bus server is an abstraction of the DBus server. An S-Bus server is
always identified with an UNIX socket located in the directory
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/lib/sss/pipes/private</span></code>. Two processes act as an S-Bus server in
the SSSD:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The monitor - Both the responders and the Data providers establish
connection to the monitor after startup. The monitor then
periodically sends &#8220;pings&#8221; to the worker processes to check if they
are still up and running. The other S-Bus methods the monitor can
invoke include &#8220;rotateLogs&#8221; to force log rotation or &#8220;resetOffline&#8221;
to force that the next operation attempts to contact the remote
server regardless of the connection status. The complete list of
methods is in
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/monitor/monitor_interfaces.h#n41">​src/monitor/monitor_interfaces.h</a><ul>
<li>listens on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/lib/sss/pipes/private/sbus-monitor</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Data Providers - The Responder processes connect to the Data
Provider processes with a cache update request. The Data Provider
then communicates with the remote server, updates the cache and sends
a message back to the responder, indicating that the cache was
updated. Each responder calls a different DBus method depending on
the data type the cache should be updated with. For example, the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getAccountInfo</span></code> method is called from the NSS.<ul>
<li>listens on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/lib/sss/pipes/private/sbus-dp_$domain_name</span></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-kinds-of-messages">
<h3>Two kinds of messages<a class="headerlink" href="#two-kinds-of-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The SSSD sends an SBUS message between two of its components under two
different circumstances:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When a request is received, completing the request might require
communicating with another subprocess. An example of this is when a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getpwnam()</span></code> call triggers an LDAP search - the NSS responder sends
an SBUS message to the Data Provider to update the cache.</li>
<li>Control messages sent by the monitor. The monitor process (aka the
sssd process) sends periodical <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ping</span></code> messages to all subprocesses
it controls. If a subprocess doesn&#8217;t respond with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pong</span></code> message
in time, it gets killed and restarted.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means, there is ongoing sbus communication even though the sssd is
otherwise idle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unix-signals">
<h2>Unix signals<a class="headerlink" href="#unix-signals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Apart from the internal SBUS communication, SSSD also uses UNIX signals
for certain functionality - either for communication with external
utilities or for cases where the SBUS communication might not work, such
as an unresponsive worker process. Below is an overview of the supported
signals and their use. The singal handlers are typically integrated with
the tevent event loop using its <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tevent_add_signal</span></code> call.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>SIGTERM</dt>
<dd>If a responder or a provider process fails to send a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pong</span></code>
message to the monitor process after receiving the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ping</span></code> message,
the monitor terminates the unresponsive process with a SIGTERM. Also
used to terminate helper processes (such as the krb5_child process)
in case of a timeout.</dd>
<dt>SIGKILL</dt>
<dd>In cases where an unresponsive worker process does not terminate
after receiving SIGTERM, the monitor forcibly kills it with SIGILL</dd>
<dt>SIGUSR1</dt>
<dd>Can be handled a sssd_be process individually or the monitor
process (in that case, the monitor re-sends the signal to all
sssd_be processes it handles). Upon receiving this signal, the
sssd_be process transitions into the &#8216;offline&#8217; state. This signal
is mostly useful for testing.</dd>
<dt>SIGUSR2</dt>
<dd>Similar to the SIGUSR1 signal, the SIGUSR2 would cause an sssd_be
process to reset the offline status and retry the next request it
receives against a remote server.</dd>
<dt>SIGHUP</dt>
<dd>Can be delivered to the sssd process. After receiving SIGHUP, the
monitor rotates its logfile and sends a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reset</span></code> method to the
managed processes. The managed processes also rotate logfiles. In
addition, the sssd_be processes re-read resolv.conf and the
sssd_nss process clears the fast in-memory cache.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="local-sockets">
<h2>Local sockets<a class="headerlink" href="#local-sockets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After startup, the SSSD also creates several local (AF_UNIX) sockets to
listen on. These sockets are used by the NSS and PAM modules and also
the external programs SSSD integrates with, such as sudo, OpenSSH or
autofs. All consumers use the sockets in a similar fashion, so they can
be commonly called SSS clients.</p>
<p>The clients all employ a request/response protocol. using its own
TLV-encoding. Note that the SSS clients only support synchronous I/O, so
it may block (e.g. while waiting for a response). On the other hand, the
responders supports asynchronous I/O using its tevent main loop, so it
will not block (e.g. while waiting to read from a client).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kdcinfo-files">
<h2>KDCInfo files<a class="headerlink" href="#kdcinfo-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD might discover additional KDC or Kadmin servers that are not
defined in krb5.conf. However, it would still be prudent if tools like
kinit or kpasswd could talk to the same servers the SSSD talks to. To
this end, the SSSD implements a plugin for libkrb5, located in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/tree/src/krb5_plugin/sssd_krb5_locator_plugin.c">​sssd_krb5_locator_plugin.c</a>
file. When a new KDC is discovered, the sssd_be process writes the IP
address of this KDC into a file under the /var/lib/sss/pubconf
directory. With the help of the locator plugin, libkrb5 is able to read
these files in the pubconf directory and use the KDC servers discovered
by the SSSD.</p>
