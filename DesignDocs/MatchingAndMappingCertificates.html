<h4 id="Mapping">Mapping</h4>
<p>
Currently it is required that a certificate used for authentication is either stored in the LDAP user entry or in a matching override. This might not always be applicable and other ways are needed to relate a user with a certificate.
</p>
<h4 id="Matching">Matching</h4>
<p>
Even if SSSD will support multiple certificates on a Smartcard in the context of <a class="ext-link" href="https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/3050"><span class="icon">​</span>https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/3050</a> it might be necessary to restrict (or relax) the current certificate selection in certain environments. 
</p>
<h3 id="Usecases">Use cases</h3>
<h4 id="Mapping1">Mapping</h4>
<p>
In some environments it might not be possible or would cause unwanted effort to add certificates to the LDAP entry of the users to allow Smartcard based authentication. Reasons might be:
</p>
<ul><li><a class="missing wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/Certificates/Smartcards.html" rel="nofollow">Certificates/Smartcards?</a> are issued externally
</li><li>LDAP schema extension is not possible or not allowed
</li></ul><h4 id="Matching1">Matching</h4>
<p>
A user might have multiple certificate on a Smartcard which are suitable for authentication. But on some host in the environment only certificates from a specific CA (while all other CAs are trusted as well) or with some special extension should be valid for login.
</p>
<h3 id="Overviewofthesolution">Overview of the solution</h3>
<p>
To match a certificate a language/syntax has to be defined which allows to reference items from the certificate and compare the values with the expected data. To map the certificates to a user the language/syntax should allow to relate certificate items with LDAP attributes so that the value(s) from the certificate item can be used in a LDAP search filter.
</p>
<h3 id="Implementationdetails">Implementation details</h3>
<p>
Since certificates form different CAs (i.e. a different issuer) might have different properties and might be used in different domains mapping rules cannot be applied unconditionally but only to "matching" certificates. On the other hand it is not sufficient to know that a certificate is valid for authentication if it cannot be determine which users should be authenticated. This illustrates that mapping and matching rules should be used together.
</p>
<p>
Besides the two rules there are two additional optional items to improve mapping and matching. Mapping rules should be accompanied by a domain list which contains a list of DNS domain names in which the user should be searched. This will help to speed up searches and to avoid to leak information to unrelated (but trusted) domains. In a complex environment with many trusted domains a certificate might be assigned to any user. And since it might be possible that the certificate is assigned to multiple users searching cannot be stop after one matching user was found. This means that without a domain list every single trusted domain has to be checked. If the domain list a missing the default should be to only search the local domain.
</p>
<p>
If certificates from many different issuers are used in an environment might might be useful to have a matching rules which defines the minimal requirements at a certificate. This rule will of courses not restrict the issuer but will match all issuers.
On the other hand there might be issuers where the certificates needs special attention and more than the minimal requirement are needed. To make sure that for this issuer there is no fallback to the catch-all rules an extra issuer attribute would make sure that for the given issuer only those rules will be applied and there is no fallback to other rules.
</p>
<p>
As a result there four item which build certificate authentication rule, the mapping and matching rule, a domain list and the issuer. All items are optional. If there is no rule at all the current behavior is used as default.
</p>
<p>
Coming use-case might require and extension of the current mapping and matching rule or a completely different syntax is needed to cover a use case. To make it possible to add new rule styles there should be a tag prefix to indicate what style is expected to follow. For the tag I would suggest a strings of upper-case ASCII characters (A(0x41)-Z(0x5a) and numbers (0(0x30)-9(0x39) with a trailing colon (:(0x3a)). E.g. 'KRB5:', 'RFC4523:', 'LDAP:'.
</p>
<p>
SSSD will provide a library which will consume the rules to generate LDAP search filters for its own usages to server matching users on remote LDAP servers or in the local cache. Additionally it will provide an interface to check if a given user object will match according to the rules which can be use by the PKINIT matching plugin. To most suitable representation for the user object (LDAPMessage, krb5_db_entry or something else) must still be determined. To initialize the library a list of LDAPMessage objects can be passed to an initialization function which will return an opaque context.
  
</p>
<h4 id="Matching2">Matching</h4>
<p>
The pkinit plugin of MIT Kerberos must find a suitable certificate from a Smartcard as well and has defined the following syntax (see the pkinit_cert_match section of the krb5.conf man page or <a class="ext-link" href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-1.14/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-1.14/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html</a> for details). The main components are
</p>
<ul><li>&lt;SUBJECT&gt;regular-expression
</li><li>&lt;ISSUER&gt;regular-expression
</li><li>&lt;SAN&gt;regular-expression
</li><li>&lt;EKU&gt;extended-key-usage-list
</li><li>&lt;KU&gt;key-usage-list
</li></ul><p>
and can be grouped together with a prefixed '&amp;&amp;' (and) or '<tt>||</tt>' (or) operator ('&amp;&amp;' is the default). If multiple rules are given they are iterated with the order in the config file as long as a rule matches exactly one certificate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Question: MIT Kerberos use case-sensitive matching and POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax, shall we do the same?</strong>
</p>
<p>
While &lt;SUBJECT&gt; and &lt;ISSUER&gt; are (imo) already quite flexible I can see some potential extensions for the other components.
</p>
<p>
&lt;EKU&gt; and &lt;KU&gt; in MIT Kerberos only accept certain string values related to some allowed values in those field as defined in <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt</a> . The selection is basically determined by what is supported on server side of the pkinit plugin of MIT Kerberos. Since we plan to extend pkinit and support local authentication without pkinit as well I would suggest to allow OID strings for those components as well (the comparison is done on the OID level nonetheless).
</p>
<p>
The &lt;SAN&gt; component in MIT Kerberos only checks the otherName SAN component for the id-pkinit-san OID as defined in <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4556.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4556.txt</a> or the szOID_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME OID as mentioned in <a class="ext-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/287547"><span class="icon">​</span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/287547</a>. While this is sufficient for the default pkinit user case of MIT Kerberos I would suggest to extend this component by allowing to specific an OID with &lt;SAN:O.I.D&gt;
</p>
<p>
The prefix tag for this type of matching rules would be 'KRB5:' and I would suggest to take this a default, i.e. if the prefix tag is missing 'KRB5:' will be assumed.
</p>
<h4 id="Matching-alternativeRFC4523syntax">Matching - alternative RFC4523 syntax</h4>
<p>
Based on the X.509 <a class="missing wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/CertificateAssertion.html" rel="nofollow">CertificateAssertion?</a> syntax <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4523.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC4523</a> introduces Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER)-based (<a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3641.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC3641</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3642.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC3642</a>) syntax to write <a class="missing wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/CertificateAssertions.html" rel="nofollow">CertificateAssertions?</a> which can be used to match certificates as well.
</p>
<p>
A matching rule for an issuer would look like
</p>
<pre class="wiki">{ issuer "cn=CA,dc=example,dc=com" }
</pre><p>
There is an identifier for keyUsage as well
</p>
<pre class="wiki">{ issuer "cn=CA,dc=example,dc=com" , keyUsage { digitalSignature , keyEncipherment } }
</pre><p>
but it looks like there is none specific for the extendedKeyUsage which is important to separate certificate eg. for email signing and for login purposes. I think even nameConstraints cannot be use here because according to X.509 "nameConstraints matches if the subject names ..." which only include the subject and the subject alternative names (please let me know if there is a standardized way to add assertions for extensions like the extendedKeyUsage).
</p>
<p>
Besides extendedKeyUsage there are other components in the certificate where we want to add matching rules in the future which are currently not handled by RFC4523. E.g. 'Authority Information Access' (see <a class="ext-link" href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC5280 section 4.2.2.1</a> where information about CRLs or OCSP responders are stored. With this we would be able to only select certificates which have an OCSP responder defined or where we known that the CRL is updated regularly. 
</p>
<p>
Although it would be possible to add new assertion for our usage seamlessly I think it would not be a good idea to do this without making sure that they will be added to any new versions of RFC4523. I currently have no idea how easy or hard this would be and how this would limit our flexibility to react on request from users and customers.
</p>
<p>
To restrict the matching not only to a single certificate but to a group of certificates based on the subject (owner) name constraints as defined in <a class="ext-link" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280.html#section-4.2.1.11"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC3280 section 4.2.1.11</a> can be used. The constraints are applied to the subject name and subject alternative names attributes in the certificate and consist of a list of allowed names (permittedSubtrees) and rejected names (excludedSubtrees). For directory names (the subject name and the related SAN attribute) an area in the directory tree can be specified where the names should match. E.g. to match all subject names from the 'research' department but not from sub-departments of 'research'
</p>
<pre class="wiki">{ permittedSubtrees { ( base "CN=research,DC=example,DC=com" , minimum 1, maximum 1 ) } }
</pre><p>
can be used. To allow everything but the 'no_access' subtree
</p>
<pre class="wiki">{ excludedSubtrees { ( base "CN=no_access,DC=example,DC=com" ) } }
</pre><p>
can be used, 'minimum' and 'maximum' are not needed here because the default for 'minimum' is '0' and a missing 'maximum' specifies the whole subtree.
</p>
<p>
Compared the regular-expressions this syntax makes it easy to reject specific types of names. But it also requires that a full base is specified and only a simple '*key_string*'. This is of course more safe but it has to be noted that the matching rules are only applied on valid and verified certificates. Since CA certificates can contain name constraints as well and <a class="ext-link" href="http://nmav.gnutls.org/2016/06/restricting-scope-of-ca-certificates.html"><span class="icon">​</span>with p11-kit it is even possible to staple those extensions</a> it would be possible to reject certificates system-wide already during the verification.
</p>
<p>
Based on this I would suggest to reserve the prefix tag 'RFC4523:' for this type of matching rule but postpone the implementation.
</p>
<h5 id="Issuerspecificmatching">Issuer specific matching</h5>
<p>
Although the MIT Kerberos rules allow to select the issuer of a certificate there are use cases where a more specific selection is needed. E.g. if there are some default matching rules for all issuers and some other issuer specific rules where the default rules should not apply. To make this possible with the above scheme the default rules must have an &lt;ISSUER&gt; clause which matches all but the issuer with the specific rules. Writing regular-expressions to not match a specific string or a list of strings is at least error-prone if not impossible.
</p>
<p>
To make it easier to define issuer specific rules and default rules at the same time and optional issuer string can be added to the rule to indicate that for the given issuer only those rules should be considered. Given the use-case I think it is acceptable to require that the full issuer must be specified here in LDAP order (see below) and case-sensitive matching is used.
</p>
<p>
How the issuer string is linked to the matching rules depends on the storage (LDAP or sssd.conf, see below for details). 
</p>
<h4 id="Mapping2">Mapping</h4>
<p>
Since different certificates, e.g. issued by different CAs, might have different mapping rule, a matching rule must be added if there are more than 1 mapping rule. A single mapping rule without a matching rule might be used as default/catch-all rule in this case.
</p>
<p>
If multiple rules matches the derived LDAP filter components can be grouped with the or-operator "|".
</p>
<p>
With trusted AD forests the mapped users might come from trusted domains as well. To avoid searching in every single domain a list of expected domains can be added to each mapping rule. If the list is empty the local domain is assumed by default. An option might be added to switch the behavior to search all domains if the list is empty.
</p>
<p>
Similar to Active Directory we will require a dedicated LDAP attribute in the user entry (anchor) to map the certificate to the user entry. Mapping rules which allow to search users based on some data from the certificate and common LDAP attributes make it easy to roll out certificate based authentication in existing environments. E.g. if one of the SAN attributes in the certificate contains the email address of the user a single mapping rule is needed to map every user with a certificate. No changes to existing LDAP user objects are needed.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand certificates issues by external CA might not contain data to reliable match all users based on common LDAP attributes. Or it should be possible to authenticate with a single certificate as multiple different users. In those cases a dedicated attributes is needed in the user entry which contains some information about the certificate like the altSecurityIdentities attribute used by Active Directory.
</p>
<p>
A specific per-user attribute also relates to other authentication methods available for a users. Password hashes and Kerberos keys are stored in the user entry as well. OTP tokens are managed in separate objects but contain the DN of the user as a unique reference. In all cases the removal of a single attribute will disable/remove a specific authentication method for a user.
</p>
<p>
Finally, since mapping is about searching a user entry in the LDAP tree the dedicated attribute can be indexed to speed up the searches and help to avoid a high server load.
</p>
<h5 id="CompatibilitywithActiveDirectory">Compatibility with Active Directory</h5>
<p>
With trusted AD forests we have to support the mapping anchors used by AD which is typically an issue-subject pair like e.g. <em>X509:&lt;I&gt;C=US,O=InternetCA,CN=APublicCertificateAuthority&lt;S&gt;C=US,O=Fabrikam,OU=Sales,CN=Jeff Smith</em>.
Active Directory uses a per-user LDAP attribute <a class="ext-link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc220106.aspx"><span class="icon">​</span>altSecurityIdentities</a> to allow arbitrary user-certificate mappings if there is no suitable user-principal-name entry in the SAN of the certificate or if a single certificate should be used to authenticate as different users.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there is no single document where all values and use-case of this attribute are listed. The best overview I found is in <a class="ext-link" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/spatdsg/2010/06/18/howto-map-a-user-to-a-certificate-via-all-the-methods-available-in-the-altsecurityidentities-attribute/"><span class="icon">​</span>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/spatdsg/2010/06/18/howto-map-a-user-to-a-certificate-via-all-the-methods-available-in-the-altsecurityidentities-attribute/</a>. In <a class="ext-link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms677943%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><span class="icon">​</span>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms677943%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a> it is explained how altSecurityIdentities is used for user object and only mentions the issue-subject pair as an example, but does not mention other cases. <a class="ext-link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh536384.aspx"><span class="icon">​</span>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh536384.aspx</a> explains what is required for PKINIT which includes the issuer-subject pair but allows 5 other variants as well. (Interestingly, the user related page says that using only the issuer &lt;I&gt; is allowed but not using only the subject &lt;S&gt; while the PKINIT page says that using only the subject &lt;S&gt; is allowed and does not list a usage with only the issue &lt;I&gt;. I guess it is a typo in the user page, because &lt;S&gt; contains user specific information while &lt;I&gt; is the same for all certificates from the given issuer).
</p>
<p>
So it looks like the most important variant is the issuer-subject pair. This one is e.g. created when a certificate is added via the 'Name Mappings' context menu entry in AD's 'Users and Computers' utility ('Advanced Features' must be activated in the 'View' menu). The attribute value might look like
</p>
<pre class="wiki">altSecurityIdentities: X509:&lt;I&gt;O=Red Hat,OU=prod,CN=Certificate Authority&lt;S&gt;DC
 =com,DC=redhat,OU=users,OID.0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1=sbose,E=sbose@redhat.co
 m,CN=Sumit Bose Sumit Bose
</pre><p>
First it can be seen that X.500 ordering is used. Second, if RDN types not explicitly mentioned in the RFCs are used, you are on your own. As can be seen AD can translate the deprecated OID <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.oid-info.com/get/1.2.840.113549.1.9.1"><span class="icon">​</span>1.2.840.113549.1.9.1</a> and uses 'E' as NSS. But the OID <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.oid-info.com/get/0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1"><span class="icon">​</span>0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1</a> which is explicitly mentioned in RFC4514 is not translated as UID but the plain OID syntax is used (my guess it that Microsoft tries to be compatible with "older" versions because the UID was added in RFC2253 from 1997 but was not present in the RFC1779 from 1995 and RFC1485 from 1993).
</p>
<p>
This leads us to mapping rules like &lt;ALT-SEC-ID-I-S:ldapAttributeName&gt; which would try in a best effort to produce the exact attribute value AD is using. This should work reliable with standard RDN types (see above). I think an optional 'ldapAttributeName' is useful here so that the same mapping rule can be used with different LDAP servers (e.g. IPA) where user-specific mapping attributes are used with the same content but a different attribute name.
</p>
<p>
According to the blob post describing altSecurityIdentities some other additional mapping rules might be useful too. This will give us
</p>
<ul><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-I-S:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-S:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-SKI:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-I-SR:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-SHA1-PUBKEY:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-RFC822:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li><li>&lt;ALT-SEC-ID-TP-PUBKEY:ldapAttribute&gt; (?)
</li></ul><p>
(The last is mentioned in <a class="ext-link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn408946.aspx"><span class="icon">​</span>MS-DVRE section 2.3.3.</a> but seems to be specific for joining devices in Azure)
</p>
<p>
So far I didn't found a AD tool which creates to other mappings, if you know one, please let me know.
</p>
<p>
Besides altSecurityIdentities AD uses the SAN with the szOID_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME OID to map users. It has to be noted that AD does not only look at the 'userPrincipalName' LDAP attribute to map the principal from the certificate but uses the default principal of an AD user <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:'samAccountName@AD.REALM"><span class="icon">​</span>'samAccountName@AD.REALM</a>' as well. Interestingly a 'Kerberos:user@AD.REALM' entry in altSecurityIdentities did not work in my tests and AD denied login. So what AD does currently matches how SSSD tried to resolve a fully-qualified name against AD. I would suggest a mapping rule like
</p>
<ul><li>&lt;NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME:ldapAttributeName&gt;
</li></ul><p>
to allow the search the user with the SAN value. When the backend is talking to AD and the principal cannot be found the fallback search with the 'samAccountName' LDAP is used. Since <a class="ext-link" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc238488.aspx"><span class="icon">​</span>MS-PKCS Appendix A</a> explicitly says that id-pkinit-san is ignored it does not have to be included for this mapping rule.
</p>
<h5 id="UsingtheCertificateasananchor">Using the Certificate as an anchor</h5>
<p>
For IPA and other generic LDAP servers an LDAP attribute like e.g. userCertificate is a good anchor as well and is currently already used to allow local authentication with a Smartcard. Since it is the current default I would suggest that an empty mapping rule with use the LDAP attribute configured by the SSSD option ldap_user_certificate as anchor and search with the whole certificate.
</p>
<p>
It has to be noted that having the binary certificate in the userCertificate LDAP attribute is not sufficient for pkinit on AD. Either checks in the matching rule, e.g. checking if a SAN with szOID_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME OID is available, or mapping rules from above should be used if pkinit is required with AD.
</p>
<h5 id="Futureconsideration">Future consideration</h5>
<p>
A mapping rule can use a similar syntax like the matching rule where the LDAP attribute can be added with a ':', e.g.
</p>
<ul><li>&lt;ISSUER:O.I.D.:ldapAttributeName:*&gt;
</li><li>&lt;SUBJECT:O.I.D.:ldapAttributeName:*&gt;
</li><li>&lt;SAN:O.I.D.:ldapAttributeName:*&gt;
</li></ul><p>
where O.I.D. is either the OID or name of a RDN type or the OID or some well-known-name of the SAN component respectively. Since the SUBJECT might contain multiple RDNs of the same type always the "most specific" is selected because in general this will be the most suited one to map the certificate to a specific user. "most specific" means the last in X.500 order and the first in LDAP order (see discussion below for details).
</p>
<p>
If the O.I.D. is missing the full SUBJECT/ISSUER is used for mapping. If 'DN' is used as ldapAttributeName SUBJECT is expected to be the DN of the user. If the O.I.D. is missing in the SAN case the same default as with matching (id-pkinit-san and szOID_NT_PRINCIPAL_NAME OID) is used. If both SAN values can be found in the certificate and are different the LDAP search filter will combine both with the or-operator.
</p>
<p>
The optional '*' in the end indicates that a sub-string search (ldapAttributeName=*value*) should be used and not an exact match (ldapAttributeName=value). Please note that it depends on the server-side definition of the LDAP attribute if case-sensitive or case-insensitve matching is used.
</p>
<p>
Currently I see no usage for &lt;KU&gt; and &lt;EKU&gt; in mapping rules because they do not contain any user-specific data. If at some point we will have personal CAs we might consider to add &lt;ISSUER&gt; based mappings.
</p>
<p>
Most of the interesting values from the SAN should be directly map-able to LDAP attributes. And processing the string representation of &lt;SUBJECT&gt; might be tricky as discussed below. Nevertheless it might be possible to add to following in a future release if more complex operations on the values are needed: 
</p>
<ul><li>&lt;SUBJECT:ldapAttributeName&gt;/regexp/replacement/
</li><li>&lt;SAN:O.I.D.:ldapAttributeName&gt;/regexp/replacement/
</li></ul><p>
where "/regexp/replacement/" stands for optional sed-like substitution rules. E.g. a rule like
</p>
<pre class="wiki">&lt;SUBJECT:samAccountName&gt;/^CN=\([^,]*\).*$/\1/
</pre><p>
would take the subject string 'CN=Certuser,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com' from the certificate and generate a LDAP search filter component '(samAccountName=Certuser)' which can be included in a LDAP search filter which includes additional components like e.g. an objectClass.
</p>
<p>
The search-and-replace does not has to be sed-like because afaik there is not library which offers this and I would like to avoid implementing it. GLib e.g. has <a class="ext-link" href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Perl-compatible-regular-expressions.html#g-regex-replace"><span class="icon">​</span>g_regex_replace</a>. Since we already have a GLib dependency in SSSD due to soem utf8 helper functions using might be acceptable as well. Nevertheless it would be nice to hear if there are alternative libraries available as well.
</p>
<p>
Maybe even search-and-replace are not sufficient for all cases and something like embedded lua scripts are needed. But since certificate mapping is about access control and authorization it should be always considered if adding a new attribute to the users LDAP entry which makes mapping easy and straight-forward wouldn't be the better solution.
</p>
<h5 id="SomenotesaboutDNs">Some notes about DNs</h5>
<p>
The X.500 family of standards define names as "SEQUENCE OF <a class="missing wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/RelativeDistinguishedName.html" rel="nofollow">RelativeDistinguishedName?</a>" where the sequence is "starting with the root and ending with the object being named" (see X.501 section 9.2 for details). On the other hand RFC4514 section 2.1 says "Otherwise, the output consists of the string encoding of each <a class="missing wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/RelativeDistinguishedName.html" rel="nofollow">RelativeDistinguishedName?</a> in the RDNSequence (according to Section 2.2), starting with the last element of the sequence and moving backwards toward the first." This means that the ASN.1 encoded issuer and subject DN from the X.509 certificate can be either displayed as string in the 
</p>
<ul><li>X.500 order: DC=com,DC=example,CN=users,CN=Certuser
</li></ul><p>
or in the
</p>
<ul><li>LDAP order: CN=Certuser,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com
</li></ul><p>
As a consequence different tools will use a different order when printing the issuer and subject DN. While NSS's certutil will use the LDAP order, 'openssl x509' and gnutls's certtool will use the X.500 order (the latter might change due to <a class="ext-link" href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/111"><span class="icon">​</span>https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/111</a>).
</p>
<p>
This makes it important to specific the order which is used by SSSD for mapping and matching. I would prefer the LDAP order here. E.g. by default the AD CA uses the DN of the users entry in AD as subject in the issues certificate. So a matching rule like '&lt;SUBJECT:dn&gt;' could tell SSSD to directly search the user based on its DN (which btw is the original intention of the subject field in the certificate, only that the DN should be looked up in a more general DAP as defined by X.500 and not in the lightweight version called LDAP)

Another issue is the limited set of attribute names/types required by the RFCs (see section 4.1.2.4 of RFC 3280 and section 3 of RFC 4514). If e.g. the deprecated OID <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.oid-info.com/get/1.2.840.113549.1.9.1"><span class="icon">​</span>1.2.840.113549.1.9.1</a> is used all tools are able to identify it as an email address but OpenSSL displays it as 'emailAddress=<a class="mail-link" href="mailto:user@example.com"><span class="icon">​</span>user@example.com</a>', certtool as 'EMAIL=<a class="mail-link" href="mailto:user@example.com"><span class="icon">​</span>user@example.com</a>' and certutil as 'E=<a class="mail-link" href="mailto:user@example.com"><span class="icon">​</span>user@example.com</a>'. So matching rules should try to avoid attribute names or only the ones from <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt"><span class="icon">​</span>RFC 4514</a>:

<p>
The goal of the matching rules in MIT Kerberos is to select a single certificate from a Smartcard which will then be used for PKINIT. Since we already plan to enhance SSSD to support multiple certificates on a Smartcard and if needed prompt the user which one to use for login we should not enforce that the matching rules should return only a single certificate or nothing. 
</p>
<p>
Similar we plan to enhance SSSD to use the same certificate to log in with different user identities, e.g. as a user with standard privileges or as a user with administrator privileges. So it can make sense that multiple mapping rules apply to the same certificate and the related LDAP search filter components are or-ed together.
</p>
<p>
In many cases the login program will first ask for a user name which will help to restrict the number of suitable certificates even further and the mapping rules are only needed to check if the certificate belongs to the user trying to log in.
</p>
<p>
But gdm has a feature where gdm will detect when a Smartcard is inserted and call PAM without a user name. In this case SSSD has to determine the user name based on the certificates found on the Smartcard. If in this case multiple valid certificates are on the card and the mapping rules will return multiple users for each certificate gdm has to display a quite long selection of certificate-user pairs the user has to choose from.
</p>
<p>
So it should be underlined in the documentation that the matching and mapping rules should be detailed and specific so that for the given environment they help to avoid cases where the user is prompted to select a certificate (or user name in the gdm case) when trying to log in.

<p>
On the IPA server a new objectclass can be created to store an matching-mapping-domain rule triple together with a specific issuer. All attributes are optional because a missing mapping rule would mean that the user entry will be search with the whole certificate. A missing matching rule will indicate catch-all rule with a default mapping. If the domain is missing only the local domain will be searched. If only a specific issuer is given certificates from this issuer must be stored in the LDAP entry of the user for the local domain to make authentication possible. 
</p>
<p>
Specifying matching-mapping-domain rules in sssd.conf is a bit more complicated because SSSD does not respect multiple entries with the same keyword, only the last one is used. So all rules have to be added to a single line. To make this less error-prone and more readable the rules with all needed components can a added in individual ini-sections and in the domain section on the the name is referenced
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[domain/some.domain]

certificate_map = ....
certificate_domains = ....

[certfificate_rule/cert_rule2]
certificate_issuer = ....
certificate_match = ....
certificate_map = ....
certificate_domains = ...

</pre><p>
As an alternative the rules components can be enclosed by curly-braces '{}{}{}{}' and each rule is separated by a comma ','. A single rule in curly braces indicates a matching rule and the mapping will be done with the whole certificate. A default/catch-all mapping rule will start with an empty pair of curly braces followed by a pair containing the mapping rule. Issuer specific rules will have three pairs of curly braces where the first pair must contain an issuer string.

<h4 id="Mapping-alternativedirectuseofLDAPsearchfilters">Mapping - alternative direct use of LDAP search filters</h4>
<p>
Since the goal of the mapping rules is to create a LDAP search filter a filter template can be used to define a mapping rules a well:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">(&amp;(someAttr={issuer})(someOtherAttr=*{subject:O.I.D}*))
</pre><p>
This offers much more flexibility in the rules. The syntax is a bit more complex but LDAP search filters are well documented and administrators should already have a basic understanding. Nevertheless a validation is needed when a new rule is entered to make sure the template can be use to generate a valid LDAP search filter.
