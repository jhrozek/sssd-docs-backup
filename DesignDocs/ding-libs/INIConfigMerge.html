This page covers the design for ticket <a class="ext-link" href="https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2247"><span class="icon">â€‹</span>https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2247</a>

<p>
In many situations the main configuration file provided by the application (SSSD or GSS proxy for example) can be or should be extended or augmented by other applications and packages installed later. It is hard and some times not desirable to modify the main configuration file. Also applications might not have privileges to change the main configuration file. 
</p>
<p>
On this design page we are going to try to define a common interface that can be provided by ding-libs INI for any application that uses libini_config library for its configuration. To be able to provide such interface we need to define the use cases and usage scenarios first.
</p>
<h1 id="GeneralUseCase">General Use Case</h1>
<p>
There have been several enhancements requests to allow configuration files to be augmented by other applications. Right now libini_config library allows reading a configuration file and then reading other configuration file and merging them together as calling application prefers. The requirement is to provide a more convenient function or set of functions to allow augmentation of the main configuration file. Augmentation can really happen in two ways: 
1) The configuration file is extended by adding additional keys or sections 
2) Values for existing keys or sections are overwritten. 
In SSSD case the example of the extension can be that a new provider or domain is added to the configuration. 
The overwrite use case is related to giving power to local administrator to overwrite some of the sections of a centrally managed configuration file. Imagine a situation when sssd.conf is centrally managed with puppet and thus any modification to it would be automatically restored. Allowing local administrator to overwrite sections or values of the configuration file will allow a better control over the application configuration.
</p>
<h1 id="Whattomerge">What to merge?</h1>
<p>
As mentioned above one can merge individual <strong>keys</strong> or <strong>sections</strong>. It is much harder to formalize the rules about merging individual keys so after some evaluation we decided to focus on merging sections only.
</p>
<h1 id="Therules">The rules</h1>
<p>
The convenience augmentation function that the API will provide assumes the following:
</p>
<ol class="loweralpha"><li>The main configuration file has been read by existing functions. The read configuration will be passed to the new function as an argument.
</li><li>All augmenting configuration files will be read from a directory of application's choice. The path to that directory will be passed as an argument to the new function. Internally the function would automatically expand the path to the absolute path so caller can use relative path if desired.
</li><li>The provided directory would be scanned for augmenting configuration files using a list of regular expressions provided by the caller. If the list is empty all files in the provided directory will be considered for merge.
</li><li>The identified files will be checked against a provided access check filter. If filter is not provided all files with all permissions and ownership will be considered.
</li><li>The list of file names would then be sorted in the lexical order.
</li><li>The files then will be parsed in that order. The function to read and parse the configuration snippets would accept same arguments to control the parsing of the snippets as the main parsing function of the interface. It would allow consistent parsing expectations while parsing the main file and the snippets that will be merged.
</li><li>Each augmenting configuration file will be treated as an independent file that can have multiple sections or no sections at all. If there is no sections the section with name "default" will be assumed in the same way how it is done with the parsing of the main configuration file.
</li><li>Once the file is parsed its section list will be validated against the list of regular expressions provided as an argument for the augmentation function. This is done to prevent merging snippets that try to overwrite sections that should not be overwritten. If the snippet contains any section that does not match any of the provided regular expressions the snippet will be ignored. If the list of regular expressions is empty all snippets would match.
</li><li>Finally valid snippets will be merged using the merge function that was previously implemented. The caller of the augmentation function will have control over merge flags that are passed down to the merge operation.
</li><li>The function would return two lists in the form of the refarray string arrays. The first list would contain any parsing and validation errors that were detected while parsing the snippets and would have the information and justification why this or that file was rejected. It is expected tha tcalling application will dump this to the log. The second list will contain the ref array of strings of the fully qualified names of the snippet files that were merged.
</li></ol><p>
For regular expressions the POSIX regex library will be used. After the evaluation we decided not to use PCRE as it will create an external dependency for a light weight library with no apparent benefit. 
If the calling application needs to do processing of different sets of snippets following different rules, for example at first augment the configuration without overwriting it and then merge in some overwrites, the application would need to call the function twice with different merge and potentially parsing flags and regex filters.
</p>
<h1 id="Limitations">Limitations</h1>
<ol class="loweralpha"><li>Merge function will not merge values. SSSD would have to be changed to deal with dropped in domains or providers.
</li><li>Merge function will not process more than one directory. To process multiple directories the function would need to be called several times.
</li></ol><h1 id="Errorprocessing">Error processing</h1>
<ul><li>It is assumed that augmentation is not a critical operation. This means that if something went wrong the application should not fail to start. It should proceed to start with the main configuration file it already read.
</li><li>Merge errors will not be critical unless it is a memory allocation issue or something similar that affects the application as a whole. 
</li><li>The refarray of errors will be returned by the merge function and can be printed by the application into the corresponding log. If the list is empty this would indicate that no errors have been encountered.
</li><li>If the refarray is not empty it needs to be freed after sending it to the corresponding log. See the unit test for example on how to do it.
</li></ul><h1 id="Permissions">Permissions</h1>
<p>
Application might elect to not trust files that have wrong permissions or ownership.
Function will accept an argument that would define what permissions and ownership are acceptable. This argument will be a pointer to structure that effectively holds the arguments to the <strong><em>int ini_config_access_check()</em></strong> function that will be called internally for every file. If argument is NULL the function will not be called. If it is not NULL the function will be called and only those files that match the specified criteria would be considered for merge. Files that do not pass the criteria will be skipped. The fact that file did not pass the access test will be recoreded as an error.

 *                              will be read from.
 * @param[in]  patterns         List of regular expressions
 *                              that the name of a snippet file
 *                              has to match to be considered
 *                              for merge.
 * @param[in]  sections         List of regular expressions
 *                              that the section names in the snippet
 *                              file need to match. If file contains
 *                              sections that do not match any patterns
 *                              the file is skipped and error is recorded.
 * @param[in]  check_perm       Pointer to structure that
 *                              holds criteria for the 
 *                              access check.
 * @param[in]  error_level      Flags that control actions
 *                              in case of parsing error in a snippet file.
 * @param[in]  collision_flags  These flags control how the potential
 *                              collisions between keys and sections
 *                              within the snippet file will be handled.
 *                              For more information
 *                              see collision flag definitions.
 * @param[in]  parse_flags      Flags that control parsing process,
 *                              for example how to handle spaces at
 *                              the beginning of the line.
 * @param[in]  merge_flags      Flags that control handling
 *                              of the duplicate sections or keys
 *                              during merging of the snippets.
 *                              They are different from the collision flags
 *                              because duplicate sections and keys inside
 *                              are snippets most likely will be handled as
 *                              'last value wins' while during merge
 *                              the attempt to overwrite
 *                              a specific section might be treated as
 *                              an error.
 * @param[out] result_cfg       A new configuration object,
 *                              the result of the merge.
 * @param[out] error_list       List of strings that
 *                              contains all encountered

 *                              is not populated.
 * @param[out] success_list     List of strings that
 *                              contains file names of snippets that were
 *                              successfully merged.
