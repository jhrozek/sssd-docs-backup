<p>
FleetCommander is a service to centrally manage Desktop environments. It includes a server to define desktop profiles and a client to apply profile information to the user's desktop session on a specified machine.
</p>
<p>
This design document describes the SSSD part of
an integration of FleetCommander with FreeIPA. The
integration is done two-fold, the IPA part of the integration is
<a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/abbra/freeipa-desktop-profile/blob/master/plugin/Feature.mediawiki"><span class="icon">​</span>documented separately</a>.

<h3 id="Usecases">Use cases</h3>
<p>
As an administrator, I want to manage desktop profiles in a centralized way
</p>
<p>
As an administrator, I want to use centrally defined users, groups, hosts and host groups to specify how desktop profiles should be applied.
</p>
<p>
As an administrator, I want to make sure desktop profiles associated with a specific user or user group are downloaded and applied on a specific FreeIPA client according to the desktop profile rules defined in FreeIPA.

<h3 id="Overviewofthesolution">Overview of the solution</h3>
<p>
FleetCommander consists on two components:
</p>
<ul><li>a web service integrated with Cockpit that serves the dynamic application and the profile data to the network.
</li><li>and a client side daemon that runs on every host of the network.
</li></ul><p>
Since this design page deals with the client side of the whole picture, this paragraph will focus on the integration of the FC client side daemon with SSSD.
</p>
<p>
The FC profiles will be downloaded by a new <tt>session_provider</tt> of IPA. This
provider will do nothing by default and will include an option to download
FC rules from IPA LDAP (perhaps <tt>ipa_enable_deskprofile = True</tt>).
</p>
<p>
In order to minimize the required client-side configuration changes, enabling
the Fleet Commander client side deamon will drop SSSD configuration that
enables the SSSD functionality and restarts SSSD.
</p>
<p>
When a FreeIPA domain user logs in, the IPA provider will download the Fleet
Commander profile and rule objects and drop the resulting JSON files into
a per-user directory. The file names must be normalized and prepended with
priority (please refer to the IPA design page for more details).
</p>
<p>
In the future, we would like to link the Fleet Commander profiles with
HBAC rules, but the first implementation will not include this part.
</p>
<h3 id="Implementationdetails">Implementation details</h3>
<p>
The implementation has two distinct parts -- enabling the IPA session
provider's Fleet Commander functionality and actually fetching the Fleet
Commander data.
</p>
<h4 id="EnablingtheIPAsessionprovider">Enabling the IPA session provider</h4>
<p>
Since searching for the Fleet Commander profiles does not come for free -
at least one LDAP search must be issued, perhaps more unless we cache the
host groups, we should only enable this functionality if the Fleet Commander
client daemon is enabled as well. To this end, enabling the FC client deamon
would trigger a one-shot systemd service that would drop an include file
to SSSD's <tt>conf.d</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
The systemd service might be implemented along these lines:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[Unit]
 ConditionFileNotEmpty=/etc/sssd/sssd.conf
 ConditionFileNotEmpty=!/etc/sssd/conf.d/deskprofile.conf

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStartPre=/bin/cp -a /usr/share/fleetcommander/sssd.snippet.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/deskprofile.conf
ExecStart=/bin/systemctl try-restart sssd
ExecStopPos=/bin/rm /etc/sssd/conf.d/deskprofile.conf
</pre><p>
This systemd unit might be stored
in <tt>/lib/systemd/system/sssd-deskprofile.service</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The sssd.snippet.conf file should look like:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[domain/example.com]
ipa_enable_deskprofile = True
</pre><p>
Having to setup the domain name is something that must be done either by the administrator or by the FC client daemon. Currently we have a Python API that provides the domains in the config file and maybe the FC client daemon could use that or maybe IPA client could generate the file and put it somewhere where it's inactive for FC client daemon to pick it up. It's a problem that still has to be solved on FC client daemon's side.
</p>
<h4 id="LookinguptheFleetCommanderprofilesandstoringtheJSONprofiledata">Looking up the Fleet Commander profiles and storing the JSON profile data</h4>
<p>
Similar to how we look up and store sudo and HBAC rules, we will look up all profiles that
apply to this host, with:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">    (&amp;(objectclass=ipadeskprofilerule)(|(memberHost=my_fqdn)(memberHost=my_hostgroup1)(memberHost=my_hostgroup2)...))
</pre><p>
All host groups the IPA client is a member of must be included in the
<tt>memberHost</tt> part of the filter. However, since in the typical scenario, sessions provider will be called after HBAC or SELinux processing was done, the host and host groups will be usually already cached and can be just reused from the cache.
</p>
<p>
Once all profiles are cached, processing and selection of the profiles that apply to the user logging in would be done offline. Again, this is similar to how we process sudo or HBAC rules. The local search's filter will look for the user and all his groups. For performance reasons, we need to check if initgroups was performed prior to looking up the profiles and only issue another initgroups request if the user entry's inigroup timestamp is expired.
</p>
<p>
The profiles will also be stored in the cache to allow offline processing. As an additional enhancement, we can skip writing the profile data to the cache if the remote data has not changed. We can take a look at the <tt>modifyTimestamp</tt> attribute value to see if any of the entries need an update in the cache.
</p>
<p>
The LDAP search will include the Fleet Commander payload data in the
profile's <tt>data</tt> attribute. Once the data are known, SSSD will write them
to the disk. Since writing to the disk is typically quite fast
</p>
<p>
The JSON files will be stored in a new directory owned by the <tt>sssd-ipa</tt>
subpackage. The top-level directory could be at <tt>/var/lib/sss/fleetcmd/</tt>
with per-user subdirectories. So each per-user JSON file would be stored at
<tt>/var/lib/sss/deskprofile/&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;profilename&gt;.json</tt>. The <tt>&lt;username&gt;</tt>
directories need to be owned by the user being logged in.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>&lt;profilename.json&gt;</tt> file must include the priority as a number which
is read from the rule's <tt>prio</tt> attribute. The Fleet Commander client deamon
will then process the JSON files in this priority. The filenames must also
be normalized so that characters with a special meaning in shell are escaped
and spaces are converted to another character such as underscores. Please
refer to the IPA design page for more details.
</p>
<p>
In the first version, the profiles will always be written again. In the
future, we might want to optimize the process further by only writing the
JSON profiles if they differ from what's already stored on the disk. This
might be doable by storing the modifyTimestamp in the JSON profiles again,
if FC is able to ignore certain JSON key-value pairs that would be private
to SSSD or just storing the largest USN value of the found profiles in
the included directory in a specially-named file.
</p>
<p>
During implementation, as much code as possible should be reused from the IPA HBAC access code and/or SELinux rule processing code.
</p>
<h3 id="Configurationchanges">Configuration changes</h3>
<p>
Two new configuration options will be added:
</p>
<ul><li><tt>session_provider</tt> that will be inherited from the <tt>id_provider</tt> value, so for IPA clients, this provider will default to <tt>ipa</tt>. A default <tt>session_provider</tt> for other providers will just shortcut and return success.
</li><li>An option that enables the FC rules and profiles processing. A proposed option name is <tt>ipa_enable_deskprofile</tt> with boolean semantics.
</li></ul><h3 id="HowToTest">How To Test</h3>
<p>
Please see the use-cases above.
</p>
<h3 id="HowToDebug">How To Debug</h3>
<p>
DEBUG messages will be added to the new session provider so that the admin
can trace if the session provider was invoked at all. An easy way to debug
the integration is to enable the sessions provider and the FleetCommander
integration manually w/o dropping the file by the FC client side daemon.
