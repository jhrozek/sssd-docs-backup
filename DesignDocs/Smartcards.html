<h3>Proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Modify request/reply messages from pam_sss to responder to backends.</li>
<li>Request and reply messages passed between pam_sss and responder need
to add an identifier to distinguish one ongoing authentication
attempt from another.<ul>
<li>This value is under control of a possibly-not-trustworthy
pam_sss, so if it isn&#8217;t the value that we designate for
requesting a new attempt (either 0 or -1), it should be checked
for correspondence with an ongoing authentication attempt before
we do anything else for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Request and reply messages passed between responder and data provider
need to add an identifier to distinguish one ongoing authentication
attempt from another.<ul>
<li>Because the responder is multiplexing requests from multiple
pam_sss instances, this identifier should be not be the same as
the one received from pam_sss in a request message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reply messages over both connections (pam_sss-to-responder, and
responder-to-provider) need to be able to carry multiple questions
back to a requester. A request message needs to be able to supply
answers for any subset of those questions.</li>
<li>The initial request also needs to start carrying some flags. If set,
the client (which, because PAM conversation callbacks are blocking,
probably won&#8217;t be pam_sss) is indicating that it can handle updates
to the list of questions for a given authentication attempt.<ul>
<li>The responder can indicate that a smart card was inserted by
adding a request for the card&#8217;s PIN to the list of questions and
sending the new list of questions to the responder&#8217;s client.</li>
<li>The responder can similarly indicate that input is no longer
required if authentication happened out-of-band or has timed out.</li>
<li>The provider will likely emit signals or issue method calls to the
responder to get the responder to forward updated information to
the responder&#8217;s client if that information has been asked for.</li>
<li>If we get the provider and responder talking at each other in an
unsynchronized manner like this, request identifiers are going to
have to stay unique over a sufficiently-large period of time that
simply discarding previously-queued-but-unprocessed updates will
keep clients of the responder from getting confused by a backlog
of updates which pertain to a previous authentication attempt.</li>
<li><strong>TODO</strong> run this by the GDM folks, to make sure it&#8217;s the sort of
info they&#8217;re going to be able to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reply messages will need to convey status that isn&#8217;t just a PAM
result code: { no-such-auth-attempt-id, got-questions-for-you,
auth-failed, auth-succeeded }.</li>
<li>Suggested prompt layout for reply messages: an array of tuples.
[(group,questionid,type,details),...]<ul>
<li>group: an integer identifier for a group of related questions</li>
<li>questionid: integer identifying a specific question in a group</li>

directly. Medium-to-longer term, we may need to add to what
PKINIT provides here.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The responder needs to be able to filter the list of questions it
gets from the provider to remove questions for kinds of data which
the administrator does not want to allow to be used for
authenticating users, passing back to the client only a subset of
the questions that the provider requested be asked. The list of
questions could even be pared down to nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suggested answer form for request messages: another tuple array.
[(group,questionid,answer)...]<ul>
<li>For any group, all questionids are expected to have answers.</li>
<li>Answer formats:<ul>
<li>password → text string</li>
<li>secret → text string</li>

action)</li>
<li>swipe finger (never sent by client - out-of-band action)</li>

<li>Readers (<em>slots</em> in PKCS#11 jargon), and access to them, haven&#8217;t

<li>Cards (<em>tokens</em> in PKCS#11 jargon) have therefore been accessible to
any user on the system for the purposes of logging in to a card and
using it, or attempting to log in to a card.</li>
<li>Some cards self-destruct after a maximum number of failed login
attempts. Some of these cards can expose a flag in their
CK_TOKEN_INFO to warn that this is about to become a problem.
Experimentally, some cards which lock the user out after some number
of failed login attempts, however, don&#8217;t expose this flag.</li>
<li>Multi-user systems, or software which isn&#8217;t careful about what it

p11-kit-proxy.so by default, as it expects the name of a module to
load when using PKCS#11.</li>
<li>Loading the p11-kit-proxy.so module using NSS&#8217;s APIs gives it access
to the same set of modules that p11-kit&#8217;s native API provides, and
also adds reference counting for module initializations, which should
avoid at least one known error case that we&#8217;ve seen with the
soft-pkcs11.so module (wherein calling its initialization function a
second time nukes any still-being used state).</li>
<li><strong>TODO</strong> We can map from a responder client PID to a unit which might
have a TTY (before login) or a session with a seat (after login), but
can we map from a SLOT_INFO to a anything that lets us avoid using a
slot if it doesn&#8217;t belong to the seat on which a particular client
sits? (This bit has been bugging the author for a while now.)</li>

<li>We need to log in to the card as a user.</li>
<li>We need to find a certificate on the card for which the card also
holds the corresponding private key.<ul>
<li>Conceptually, the simplest thing is to just sign some data with
the private key, and verify it using the public key in the
certificate.</li>
<li>We <em>could</em> alternately read the specific public fields from the
private key, pull the public key out of the certificate, decode
that public key (in a manner specific to the type of key), and
compare the two, but we still wouldn&#8217;t know for sure that the
private parts of the key were correct. And we&#8217;d have extend this
code for every new type of key pair we wanted to support into the
future. So we&#8217;ll just do the sign/verify, like pam_pkcs11 does.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We need to verify that that certificate is issued by an issuer who is
trusted to issue certificates for login. The set of CAs which we
trust to do that is almost certainly going to be a much smaller set
than the full set of commercial CAs that we trust for issuing SSL
server certificates.</li>
<li>We need to verify that that certificate is suitable for login, i.e.,
not just for signing email and/or visiting web sites. On Windows
KDCs, and on MIT KDCs by default, this is indicated with a particular
value in the extendedKeyUsage extension. Large client rollouts may
have deployed cards with certificates containing one or the other or
neither, so this needs to be a requirement that we can relax through
configuration.</li>

<li><strong>TODO</strong> seek guidance and assistance from the p11-kit

<h3>Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A certificate contains a subject field which identifies the owner of
the public key in the certificate. This is a distinguished name,
similar in many ways to an LDAP DN, mainly differing in that it&#8217;s
encoded as a DER blob, with attribute types represented by OIDs
rather than by name, and with values encoded as DER strings of one of
several types.</li>
<li>A certificate can also contain one or more subjectAlternativeName
extension values. If it contains any of these, the subject field
becomes optional. Each subjectAlternativeName (SAN) value is
considered equally canonical. SAN values can take multiple forms,
including but not limited to distinguished names, DNS names, IP
addresses, email addresses, and Kerberos principal names.</li>
<li>Somehow, we have to use this naming information to figure out if the
certificate belongs to the account.</li>
<li>For tech demo situations, we&#8217;d like to be able to use this

creds for the account&#8217;s principal, we&#8217;re done.<ul>
<li>This <em>should</em> handle matching using <em>altSecurityIdentity</em>
information for us if we&#8217;re talking to an AD server.</li>

client&#8217;s certificate if it contains the principal name as a SAN
value. We&#8217;ll want to be able to extend that.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget that we need to verify the KDC&#8217;s certificate, and its
suitability to be issuing Kerberos tickets for the realm of the
account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LDAP (possibly AD and IPA as well):<ul>
<li>Let the server decide — connect to server using TLS with client
auth and SASL/EXTERNAL, use whoami EXOP to read our entry DN,
compare to the account&#8217;s DN.<ul>
<li>With NSS, this <em>should</em> only require setting
LDAP_OPT_X_TLS_CERTFILE to &#8220;tokenname:certnickname&#8221;,

<li>When we start issuing client certificates in FreeIPA, we&#8217;ll
need to make sure that FreeIPA&#8217;s configuring dirsrv&#8217;s
certmap.conf to pull the right attribute from the subject DN
and construct a search that will match the user&#8217;s entry.</li>
<li><strong>TODO</strong> figure out if there&#8217;s a way to take the
CK_FUNCTION_LIST which p11-kit/PKCS#11 gives us and hand it
to the copy of NSS that libldap is using under the covers.</li>

</li>
<li>Let the server merely hold the info — search for an entry that
contains a copy of the certificate that&#8217;s on the token as a
userCertificate value, check results.</li>
<li>Implement something like certmap.conf logic at the client.</li>
<li>Compare the subject/SAN DN to the user&#8217;s entry&#8217;s DN.<ul>
<li>This is trickier than it sounds: converting from the binary
encoding used in the certificate&#8217;s fields to the text format
used by LDAP requires that we map the OIDs of attributes to the
name of the naming attribute used in the LDAP DN. Converting
the LDAP DN to binary form may work better, but that&#8217;s just a
guess.</li>
