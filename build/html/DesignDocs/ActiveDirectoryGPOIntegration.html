<h2>Problem Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common use case for managing computer-based access control in an AD
environment is through the use of GPO policy settings related to Windows
Logon Rights. This design page proposes adding support for this use case
by enhancing the SSSD AD provider to include the GPO support necessary
for this access control use case. We are not currently planning on
supporting other GPO-based use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Administrator, who maintains a heterogenous AD and RHEL network is able
to define login policies in one central place &#8211; on the AD DC. The same
policies will be then honored by his RHEL clients and Windows clients
alike. Mapping between interactive or remote Windows logon methods and
RHEL PAM services has sensible defaults and can be customized further.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-solution">
<h2>Proposed Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#proposed-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a general overview of GPO technology, visit <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/GpoOverview.html">GPO
Overview</a></p>
<p>For a general overview of Windows Logon Rights, visit
<a class="reference external" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc976701.aspx">​http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc976701.aspx</a></p>
<p>GPO policy settings can be used to centrally configure several sets of
Windows Logon Rights, with each set classified by its logon method (e.g.
interactive, remote interactive) and consisting of a whitelist [and
blacklist] of users and groups that are allowed [or denied] access to
the computer using the set&#8217;s logon method. In order to integrate Windows
Logon Rights into a Linux environment, we allow pam service names to be
mapped to a specific Logon Right. We provide default mappings for all of
the commonly used pam service names, but we also allow the admin to
add/remove mappings as needed (to support custom pam service names, for
example). The latter is done by using a new set of config options of the
form &#8220;gpo_map_&lt;logon_right&gt;&#8221; (i.e. gpo_map_interactive,
gpo_map_network, etc), each of which consists of a comma-separated
list of entries beginning either with a &#8216;+&#8217; (for adding to default set)
or a &#8216;-&#8216; (for removing from default set). For example, since the
RemoteInteractive logon right maps to a single pam service name (&#8220;sshd&#8221;)
by default, an admin could map their own pam service name
(&#8220;my_pam_service&#8221;) and remove the &#8220;sshd&#8221; mapping with the following
sssd.conf line: &#8220;gpo_map_remote_interactive = +my_pam_service,
-sshd&#8221;</p>
<p>For this project, the following options can be used to configure the
corresponding Logon Right (default values are also given):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ad_gpo_map_interactive (default: login, su, su-l, gdm-fingerprint,
gdm-password, gdm-smartcard, kdm)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_remote_interactive (default: sshd)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_network (default: ftp, samba)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_batch (default: crond)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_service (default: &lt;not set&gt;)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_permit (default: sudo, sudo-i)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_deny (default: &lt;not set&gt;)</li>
<li>ad_gpo_map_default_right (default: deny)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first five options are used to associate specific pam service names
with each logon right. The ad_gpo_map_permit [and ad_gpo_map_deny]
is used to specify pam service names for which GPO-based access is
always [or never] granted. Unlike the other options, the
ad_gpo_map_default_right does not specify pam service names. Rather,
it allows the admin to specify a default logon right (or the special
permit/deny values)for pam service names that are not explicitly mapped
to any of the logon rights. Note that, in many cases, we do not expect
the admin will need to specify any of these config options, b/c the
defaults have been chosen carefully to cover the most commonly used pam
service names (with deny as the default for unmapped service names).</p>
<p>The semantics of each whitelist and blacklist are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>whitelist (&#8220;allow&#8221;): When this policy setting is not defined, any
user can logon to the computer. When it is defined, only the users
and groups specified in the whitelist are allowed to logon to the
computer. In other words, by defining this setting, the semantics go
from &#8220;everyone allowed access to this computer&#8221; to &#8220;no one allowed
access to this computer, except principals on the whitelist&#8221;.</li>
<li>blacklist (&#8220;deny&#8221;): When this policy setting is not defined, it has
no effect. When it is defined, the users and groups specified in the
blacklist are blocked from performing logons. For a particular Logon
Right (e.g. Interactive), if a user/group is specified in both the
whitelist and the blacklist, then the blacklist takes precedence.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, if a user is trying to login to a computer (e.g.
pam_service_name = &#8220;login&#8221;), we first find which Logon Right the
&#8220;login&#8221; service maps to (i.e. Interactive, by default), and then process
only the corresponding policy settings found in GptTmpl.inf (which
contains policy settings for the &#8220;Security Settings&#8221; extension, of which
Logon Rights are a part). In the case of Interactive Logon Right, those
policy settings are named <em>SeInteractiveLogonRight</em> and
<em>SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight</em> in the GptTmpl.inf file.</p>
<p>A client-side implementation consists of the following components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>LDAP Engine: determines which GPOs are applicable for the computer
account from which the user is attempting to log in, filters those on
various criteria, and ultimately produces a set of cse_filtered GPOs
that contain the &#8220;Security Settings&#8221; CSE, which it feeds, one by one,
to the SMB/CIFS Engine</li>
<li>SMB/CIFS Engine: makes blocking libsmbclient calls to retrieve each
GPO&#8217;s GPT.INI and GptTmpl.inf files, and stores the files in the gpo
cache (/var/lib/sss/gpo_cache), from which the GPO Enforcement
Engine will retrieve them</li>
<li>GPO Enforcement Engine: enforces GPO-based access control by
retrieving each GPO&#8217;s policy file (GptTmpl.inf) from the gpo cache,
parsing it, and making an access control decision by comparing the
user/groups against the whitelist/blacklist of the Logon Right of
interest (which is based on the pam service name)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of clarity, the above description ignores some features,
such as GPO version caching/comparing, and offline support.</p>

<div class="section" id="packaging">
<h3>Packaging<a class="headerlink" href="#packaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since the GPO-based access control feature will only be used by the AD
provider, it will be included as part of the sssd-ad package. The source
files for the feature would be included as part of libsss_ad.so. In
order to ensure that existing configurations do not see changes in
behavior when upgrading, this feature will not be enabled by default.
Rather, a new &#8220;ad_gpo_access_control&#8221; config option is provided which
can be set to &#8220;disabled&#8221; (neither evaluated nor enforced), &#8220;enforcing&#8221;
(evaluated and enforced), or &#8220;permissive&#8221; (evaluated, but not
enforced).The &#8220;permissive&#8221; value is the default, primarily to facilitate
a smooth transition for administrators; it evalutes the gpo-based access
control rules and outputs a syslog message if access would have been
denied. By examining the logs, administrators can then make the
necessary changes before setting the mode to &#8220;enforcing&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to the new ad_gpo_access_control and ad_gpo_map_*
config options, there is also a new config option named
ad_gpo_cache_timeout, which can be used to specify the interval
during which subsequent access control requests can re-use the files
stored in the gpo_cache (rather than retrieving them from the DC).</p>

<h3>Refresh Interval Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#refresh-interval-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Microsoft specifies that there be separate configurable refresh
intervals (one for computer-based GPOs and one for user-based GPOs),
with each having a default of 90 minutes. If 0 minutes are specified,
Microsoft uses a 7-second refresh interval. Additionally, in order to
avoid performance degradation that could occur if several computers
perform a group policy refresh simultaneously, Microsoft also specifies
that a random offset interval be added to the refresh interval, with the
maximum offset interval having a default of 30 minutes. As such, there
are four settings (computer-based refresh interval, computer-based
maximum offset interval, user-based refresh interval, user-based maximum
offset interval). Additionally, Microsoft specifies a boolean
configuration setting that disables refresh altogether (in which case
none of the previous four configuration settings would be relevant). If
refresh is completely disabled, then GPOs would only be retrieved at
computer startup (or user login). One final note: the GPO mechanism
itself can be used to uniformly set these refresh configuration options
for a set of computers; namely, Microsoft specifies standard GPO policy
settings that can used to centrally specify the various refresh
parameters. Of course, these would not apply until after they had been
retrieved.</p>
<p>Although we are only implementing a computer-based GPO in the first
implementation, we should keep in mind that user-based GPOs could have a
different refresh interval. As such, we would need to add a new
configuration option (&#8220;computer_gpo_refresh_interval&#8221;) to the
existing AD access provider that would specify the gpo retrieval refresh
interval in seconds. This would specify the period to use in the
periodic task API to determine how often to call the gpo retrieval code.
By default, Microsoft sets this value to 90 minutes. It is an open issue
as to whether we want to support the random offset interval or the
ability to disable refresh altogether.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unresolved-issues">
<h2>Unresolved Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#unresolved-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When should GPO retrieval take place? It could happen at one or more of
the following times:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If we follow the Microsoft spec, since &#8220;Allow / Deny Logon Locally&#8221;
are computer-based policy settings, GPO retrieval should take place
when the system boots and at regular refresh intervals. If we assume
system boot effectively coincides with sssd initialization (for our
purposes), we can retrieve the policy settings during ad_init and
kick off a periodic task (similar to what we do for enumeration).
However, this will likely have an adverse performance impact on
system startup.</li>
<li>Alternatively, we can perform GPO retrieval in the AD access provider
itself (just before enforcing the policy settings), meaning that
retrieval would take place at every user login. This would ensure
that the freshest policy settings were being applied at every logon.
If we only performed GPO retrieval at this point, then periodic
refresh would not be needed (at least for the &#8220;Allow / Deny Logon
Locally&#8221; policy settings) since we are getting fresh data every time.</li>
<li>Additionally, we could register an online callback such that GPO
retrieval takes place when returning to online mode from offline
mode. This really depends on what we decide about the first two
retrieval times above. If we aren&#8217;t doing periodic refresh, and are
only retrieving gpo&#8217;s at login time, then an online callback might
not be needed. If we are doing periodic refresh, then we can set the
&#8220;offline&#8221; parameter of be_ptask_create(...) to DISABLE (which means
the task is disabled immediately when back end goes offline and then
enabled again when back end goes back online). Or we can play it safe
and always use DISABLE semantics (regardless of when GPO retrieval
takes place).</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we enforce GPO logon policy settings only at user login, or also
at periodic intervals?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>After a user has logged on successfully using GPO-based access
control, if new policy settings are retrieved during refresh
indicating that the user is no longer allowed to log in to this host,
should sssd log out the user (or should we only enforce the access
control at login time)? What do our other access control mechanisms
do here? If we wanted to log out the user, do we have an existing
mechanism to do this?</li>
</ul>
<p>If we implement gpo refresh, which of the refresh configuration options
should we implement and how?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>sssd configuration options<ul>
<li>computer_gpo_refresh_interval? If we use sssd configuration, we
would definitely want this one (although maybe with a shorter
name).</li>
<li>computer_gpo_max_offset (default 30 minutes)? Do we think this
random offset adds enough value to be a configurable option?</li>
<li>disable_gpo_refresh (default false)? Presumably, this would be
done so that performance would not be adversely affected during
the logon session. Alternatively, we could tell admins that wanted
to disable gpo refresh to set the
entry_cache_computer_gpo_timeout to zero (0), although this
would not be how Microsoft interprets a zero value. Does sssd
interpret &#8216;0&#8217; as &#8220;disable&#8221; elsewhere?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gpo refresh interval GPO<ul>
<li>if we didn&#8217;t want to clutter sssd&#8217;s configuration namespace, we
could just use the standard Microsoft GPO that allows an admin to
specify the aforementioend refresh intervals (and distribute a
consistent configuration to a set of computers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 1: The straightforward option is to only perform GPO retrieval in
the AD access provider itself.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>provides just-in-time retrieval (yielding fresh data)</li>
<li>does away with need for periodic refresh and refresh configuration</li>
<li>no performance hit at system startup (and at periodic refresh)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>suffers a performance hit on every user login</li>
<li>doesn&#8217;t allow us to perform user logout (if policy settings no
longer allow access)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 2: The spec-compliant option is to perform GPO retrieval (and
take the performance hit) at system start and then at periodic
intervals.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>complies with spec</li>
<li>no performance hit at every user login</li>
<li>allows us to perform user logout (if policy settings no longer
allow access)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>suffers performance hit at initial startup and then periodically</li>
<li>policy data likely to be stale</li>
<li>requires implementation of periodic refresh, including refresh
configuration (for which we should probably use gpo refresh GPO)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to avoid premature optimization, the team&#8217;s recommendation is
to start by implementing the straightforward approach (Option 1), and to
address potential performance concerns later (when we will be able to
make actual measurements).</p>
