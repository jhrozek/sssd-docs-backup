</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-the-solution">
<h2>Overview of the solution<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over time, both libkrb5 and SSSD used different credential cache types
to store Kerberos credentials - going from a simple file-based storage
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FILE:</span></code>) to a directory (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DIR:</span></code>) and most recently a kernel-keyring
based cache (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEYRING:</span></code>).</p>
<p>Each of these caches has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FILE</span></code> ccache is very widely supported, but does not support
multiple primary caches. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DIR</span></code> cache does, but creating and
managing the directories including proper access control can be tricky.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEYRING</span></code> cache is not well suited for cases where multiple
semi-isolated environments might share the same kernel. Managing
credential caches&#8217; lifetime is not well solved in neither of these cache
types automatically, only with the help of a daemon like SSSD.</p>
<p>An interesting credentials cache that might solve the issues mentioned
above is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KCM</span></code>. With KCM, the Kerberos caches are not stored in a
&#8220;passive&#8221; store, but managed by a daemon. In this setup, the Kerberos
library (typically used through an application, like for example,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kinit</span></code>) is a &#8220;KCM client&#8221; and the daemon is being referred to as a
&#8220;KCM server&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having the Kerberos credential caches managed by a daemon has several
advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the daemon is stateful and can perform tasks like Kerberos credential
cache renewals or reaping old ccaches. Some tasks, like renewals are
possible already with SSSD, but only for tickets that SSSD itself
acquired (typically via a login through <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pam_sss.so</span></code>) and tracks.
Tickets acquired otherwise, most notably though kinit wouldn&#8217;t be
tracked and renewed.</li>
<li>since the process runs in userspace, it is subject to UID
namespacing, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2014/09/yet-another-reason-containers-don-t-contain-kernel-keyrings/">​unlike the kernel
keyring</a></li>
<li>unlike the kernel keyring-based cache, which is entirely dependant on
UIDs of the caller and in a containerized environment is shared
between all containers, the KCM server&#8217;s entry point is a UNIX socket
which can be bind-mounted to only some containers</li>
<li>the protocol between the client and the server can be extended for
custom operations such as dumping a cache in a different format to a
specific location. This would be beneficial for applications that
only understand a certain Kerberos ccache type - for example, some
legacy applications only know how to deal with a FILE-based cache,
thus preventing the use of cache collections</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Heimdal Kerberos implementation currently implements a KCM
server, but both Heimdal and MIT implement the client-side operations
(in libkrb5) to manage KCM-based Kerberos ccaches. This design page
describes adding a KCM server to SSSD. While it&#8217;s of course possible to
create a completely standalone daemon that would implement a KCM server,
doing so in the context of SSSD has several advantages, notably:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An easy access to the authentication provider of SSSD that already
has existing and tested code to renew Kerberos credentials on user&#8217;s
behalf</li>
<li>SSSD already has a D-Bus API that could publish information about
Kerberos tickets and for example emit signals that a graphical
application can consume</li>
<li>SSSD has a &#8216;secrets provider&#8217; to store data at rest. It makes sense
to leverage this component to store Kerberos ccaches persistently</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation-details">
<h2>Implementation details<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new SSSD responder will be added. Since accessing the Kerberos
credentials is quite an infrequent operation, the responder will be
socket-activated.</p>
<p>This responder would implement the same subset of the KCM protocol the
MIT client libraries implement. Contrary to Heimdal&#8217;s KCM server that
just stores the credential caches in memory, the SSSD KCM server would
store the ccaches in the secrets database through the sssd-secret&#8217;s
responder <a class="reference external" href="https://jhrozek.fedorapeople.org/sssd/1.14.2/man/sssd-secrets.5.html">​public REST
API</a>.</p>
<p>For user credentials the KCM Server would use a secrets responder URI
like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/kcm/users/1234/X</span></code> where 1234 is the user ID and X is the
residual. The client then gets assigned a KRB5CCNAME of KCM:1234:X.
Internally in the secrets responder we will store the credential caches
under a new base DN <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cn=kcm</span></code>.</p>
<p>The secret responder&#8217;s quota on secrets must be made modular to allow
different number of secrets per base DN (so, different number of secrets
and credentials pretty much). What to do in case the quota is reached is
debatable - we should probably first remove service (non-TGT) tickets
first for valid TGTs and if that&#8217;s not possible, just fail. A failure in
this case would be no different than a failure if a disk is full when
trying to store a FILE-based ccache.</p>
<p>The KCM responder would renew the user credentials by starting a tevent
timer which would then contact the SSSD Data Provider for the given UID
and principal, asking for the credentials to be renewed. Another tevent
timer would reap and remove a ccache that reaches its lifetime.</p>
<p>In the future, SSSD-specific operations such as writing out a FILE-based
ccache might be added. The SSSD D-Bus interface would also be extended
to publish information about credentials activity (such as - a ticket
being acquired, a ticket was renewed etc)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-changes">
<h2>Configuration changes<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD KCM responder would use the same common options like other SSSD
services such as idle timeout.</p>
<p>We will also add a configurable KCM socket location later, which will
default to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/run/.heim_org.h5l.kcm-socket</span></code> mostly because that&#8217;s
what MIT defaults to as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packaging-changes">
<h2>Packaging changes<a class="headerlink" href="#packaging-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The KCM responder will be packaged in its own subpackage called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sssd-kcm</span></code>. This subpackage will not be installed by default, in other
words it would not be required by the sssd meta-package, but a user will
have to install this subpackage manually. Except for the KCM responder
and its documentation, the package will also contain a krb5.conf snippet
that enables the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KCM</span></code> ccache type, so switching to the new
credentials cache should be as easy as installing the package.</p>
<p>The subpackage will also handle enabling the systemd-activated socket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-test">
<h2>How To Test<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order for the admin to start using the KCM service, the sssd-kcm
responder&#8217;s systemd service must be enabled. Then, libkrb5 must also be
configured to use KCM as its default ccache type in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/krb5.conf</span></code></p>
<p>After that, all common operations like kinit, kdestroy or login through
pam_sss should just work and store their credentials in the KCM server.</p>
<p>The KCM server must implement access control correctly, so even trying
to access other user&#8217;s KCM credentials by setting KRB5CCNAME to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KCM:1234:RESIDUAL</span></code> would not work (except for root).</p>
<p>Restarting the KCM server or rebooting the machine must persist the
tickets.</p>
<p>As far as automatic unit and integration testing is required, we need to
make sure that MIT&#8217;s testsuite passes with Kerberos ccache defaulting to
KCM and SSSD KCM daemon running. In the SSSD upstream, we should write
integration tests that run a MIT KDC under socket_wrapper to exercise
the KCM server.</p>

<h2>Use-case: separating ccaches of root users in containers, SSSD is running on the host<a class="headerlink" href="#use-case-separating-ccaches-of-root-users-in-containers-sssd-is-running-on-the-host" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this scenario, SSSD is running on the host and an application is
running in a container. However, the application in a container runs as
root and we want to keep its credential caches separate from the
credential caches on the host. On the other hand we want to share the
kerberos credentials between the containers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a directory that will contain the KCM daemon socket:</li>
<li>Configure sssd-kcm to spawn the KCM socket there. Add the following
to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/sssd/sssd.conf</span></code> on the host</li>
<li>Restart sssd on the host to pick up the changes and verify the socket
is there</li>
<li>In order for the root user in the container to be represented as a
different UID to the host, we need to create a subordinate UID and
GID ranges that the ID from the containers will be mapped to. This
range takes a required argument, which must correspond to a user that
exists in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></code> (although domain users <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/27599">​will be supported
starting with docker
1.13</a>). The
subordinate ranges are created in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/subuid</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/subgid</span></code>
on the host. Please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://success.docker.com/Datacenter/Apply/Introduction_to_User_Namespaces_in_Docker_Engine">​docker
documentation</a>
for more details on Docker user namespaces. For example:</li>
<li>Configure the docker daemon to use this subordinate ID namespace by
changing this line in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/sysconfig/docker</span></code></li>
<li>Restart the docker service. Please note that docker stores the images
under a per-user-namespace directory, so you&#8217;ll need to pull the
images again.</li>
<li>Start a container, bind-mounting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/run/kcm</span></code> directory from
the host to make the KCM socket accessible:</li>
<li>Configure the container&#8217;s Kerberos config file to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KCM:</span></code> as the
credential cache. Edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/krb5.conf</span></code> in the container:</li>
<li>Acquire Kerberos credentials for the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">admin</span></code> IPA user. Note that
despite the user&#8217;s UID value in the container is 0, the UID is
translated to 50000 on the host, which is what the KCM server then
uses to store the credentials at</li>
<li>Start another container, bind-mounting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/run/kcm</span></code> directory
from the host to make the KCM socket accessible:</li>
<li>Configure <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">krb5.conf</span></code> in the same manner and run klist (without
kinit!) in the container. Note we can access the same ccache the
first container acquired</li>
<li>root on the host cannot access the same cache by default. An
interesting property of the KCM protocol is that UID 0 can list all
ccaches or all other UIDs, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note - if the container is running as a different user (using the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">USER</span></code> directive specified in the container&#8217;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dockerfile</span></code>), then
the ID the KCM server is contacted with depends on whether ID namespaces
are used. Without the ID namespaces, the host receives the UID of the
container user as-is. If user namespaces are in effect, then the ID of
the container user is translated into the subordinate namespace. For
example, if the namespace above was still in effect, a container user
running as uid=1000 would be translated into user with uid=51000 on the
host.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-case-separating-ccaches-of-containers-from-ccaches-of-the-host">
<h2>Use-case: separating ccaches of containers from ccaches of the host<a class="headerlink" href="#use-case-separating-ccaches-of-containers-from-ccaches-of-the-host" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this use-case, SSSD is running in one container and keeps track of
ccaches in other containers that are completely separated from the host
environment. The containers must also share the credential caches
between one another.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start a container that will run an SSSD instace with the KCM service.
We name the container <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kcmserver</span></code> and assign a volume called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/kcmserver</span></code> to this container.</li>
<li>Install and configure sssd in the container. The configuration can be
pretty minimal, but the important piece is the KCM socket in the
Docker volume at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/kcmserver/kcm.socket</span></code>. Please note that even the
domain should hopefully not be required in future versions where the
files provider will be ran by default instead.</li>
<li>Start another container that will represent an application. Make sure
the container mounts the volume from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kcmserver</span></code> instance.</li>
<li>Observe that the container mounted the volume and the volume includes
the KCM server socket</li>
<li>Configure <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/krb5.conf</span></code> to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KCM:</span></code> as the credentials cache
and point libkrb5 to the KCM socket</li>
<li>Acquire Kerberos credentials in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kcmclient</span></code> container</li>
<li>Observe that these credentials are not visible to the host</li>
<li>Start another container as another KCM client, configure its
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">krb5.conf</span></code> configuration file in the same manner. As long as this
container runs as the same UID as the first KCM client, the
credentials should be visible in this container immediatelly without
having to acquire them:</li>

<h2>How To Debug<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-debug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SSSD KCM server would use the same DEBUG facility as other SSSD

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KRB5_TRACE</span></code> variable might come handy.</p>
<p>When debugging the setup, the admin might also inspect the SSSD secrets
database (if permissable by SELinux policy) to see what credential
caches have been stored by the SSSD.</p>
