<h1>Merging Configuration Snippets Installed in Different Locations<a class="headerlink" href="#merging-configuration-snippets-installed-in-different-locations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page covers the design for ticket
<a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2247">​https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2247</a></p>
<p>In many situations the main configuration file provided by the
application (SSSD or GSS proxy for example) can be or should be extended
or augmented by other applications and packages installed later. It is
hard and some times not desirable to modify the main configuration file.
Also applications might not have privileges to change the main
configuration file.</p>
<p>On this design page we are going to try to define a common interface
that can be provided by ding-libs INI for any application that uses
libini_config library for its configuration. To be able to provide such
interface we need to define the use cases and usage scenarios first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-use-case">
<h1>General Use Case<a class="headerlink" href="#general-use-case" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There have been several enhancements requests to allow configuration
files to be augmented by other applications. Right now libini_config
library allows reading a configuration file and then reading other
configuration file and merging them together as calling application
prefers. The requirement is to provide a more convenient function or set
of functions to allow augmentation of the main configuration file.
Augmentation can really happen in two ways: 1) The configuration file is
extended by adding additional keys or sections 2) Values for existing
keys or sections are overwritten. In SSSD case the example of the
extension can be that a new provider or domain is added to the
configuration. The overwrite use case is related to giving power to
local administrator to overwrite some of the sections of a centrally
managed configuration file. Imagine a situation when sssd.conf is
centrally managed with puppet and thus any modification to it would be
automatically restored. Allowing local administrator to overwrite
sections or values of the configuration file will allow a better control
over the application configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-merge">
<h1>What to merge?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-merge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As mentioned above one can merge individual <strong>keys</strong> or <strong>sections</strong>. It
is much harder to formalize the rules about merging individual keys so
after some evaluation we decided to focus on merging sections only.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rules">
<h1>The rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The convenience augmentation function that the API will provide assumes
the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The main configuration file has been read by existing functions. The
read configuration will be passed to the new function as an argument.</li>
<li>All augmenting configuration files will be read from a directory of
application&#8217;s choice. The path to that directory will be passed as an
argument to the new function. Internally the function would
automatically expand the path to the absolute path so caller can use
relative path if desired.</li>
<li>The provided directory would be scanned for augmenting configuration
files using a list of regular expressions provided by the caller. If
the list is empty all files in the provided directory will be
considered for merge.</li>
<li>The identified files will be checked against a provided access check
filter. If filter is not provided all files with all permissions and
ownership will be considered.</li>
<li>The list of file names would then be sorted in the lexical order.</li>
<li>The files then will be parsed in that order. The function to read and
parse the configuration snippets would accept same arguments to
control the parsing of the snippets as the main parsing function of
the interface. It would allow consistent parsing expectations while
parsing the main file and the snippets that will be merged.</li>
<li>Each augmenting configuration file will be treated as an independent
file that can have multiple sections or no sections at all. If there
is no sections the section with name &#8220;default&#8221; will be assumed in the
same way how it is done with the parsing of the main configuration
file.</li>
<li>Once the file is parsed its section list will be validated against
the list of regular expressions provided as an argument for the
augmentation function. This is done to prevent merging snippets that
try to overwrite sections that should not be overwritten. If the
snippet contains any section that does not match any of the provided
regular expressions the snippet will be ignored. If the list of
regular expressions is empty all snippets would match.</li>
<li>Finally valid snippets will be merged using the merge function that
was previously implemented. The caller of the augmentation function
will have control over merge flags that are passed down to the merge
operation.</li>
<li>The function would return two lists in the form of the refarray
string arrays. The first list would contain any parsing and
validation errors that were detected while parsing the snippets and
would have the information and justification why this or that file
was rejected. It is expected tha tcalling application will dump this
to the log. The second list will contain the ref array of strings of
the fully qualified names of the snippet files that were merged.</li>
</ol>
<p>For regular expressions the POSIX regex library will be used. After the
evaluation we decided not to use PCRE as it will create an external
dependency for a light weight library with no apparent benefit. If the
calling application needs to do processing of different sets of snippets
following different rules, for example at first augment the
configuration without overwriting it and then merge in some overwrites,
the application would need to call the function twice with different
merge and potentially parsing flags and regex filters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h1>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Merge function will not merge values. SSSD would have to be changed
to deal with dropped in domains or providers.</li>
<li>Merge function will not process more than one directory. To process
multiple directories the function would need to be called several
times.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="error-processing">
<h1>Error processing<a class="headerlink" href="#error-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is assumed that augmentation is not a critical operation. This
means that if something went wrong the application should not fail to
start. It should proceed to start with the main configuration file it
already read.</li>
<li>Merge errors will not be critical unless it is a memory allocation
issue or something similar that affects the application as a whole.</li>
<li>The refarray of errors will be returned by the merge function and can
be printed by the application into the corresponding log. If the list
is empty this would indicate that no errors have been encountered.</li>
<li>If the refarray is not empty it needs to be freed after sending it to
the corresponding log. See the unit test for example on how to do it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="permissions">
<h1>Permissions<a class="headerlink" href="#permissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Application might elect to not trust files that have wrong permissions
or ownership. Function will accept an argument that would define what
permissions and ownership are acceptable. This argument will be a
pointer to structure that effectively holds the arguments to the <strong>*int
ini_config_access_check()*</strong> function that will be called internally
for every file. If argument is NULL the function will not be called. If
it is not NULL the function will be called and only those files that
match the specified criteria would be considered for merge. Files that
do not pass the criteria will be skipped. The fact that file did not
pass the access test will be recoreded as an error.</p>

<h2>Unit testing<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Current unit test will be extended with a new test module
ini_augment_ut that would cover the new functionality.</p>
