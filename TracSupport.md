Trac Support {#TracSupport}
============

Like in most [[​]{.icon}open source
projects](http://www.opensource.org/){.ext-link}, "free" Trac support is
available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the
[[​]{.icon}mailing
list](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/MailingList "MailingList in Trac project trac"){.ext-link}
and the [[​]{.icon}project
wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/ "Trac project trac"){.ext-link}.
The latter is the authoritative source for the
[TracGuide](https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/TracGuide.html){.wiki}
(administrator and user guides for Trac).

There is also an [[​]{.icon}IRC
channel](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/IrcChannel "IrcChannel in Trac project trac"){.ext-link},
where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development
discussions also happen there.

Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the
appropriate searching:

-   in the project's
    [[​]{.icon}FAQ](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/TracFaq "TracFaq in Trac project trac"){.ext-link}
-   in past messages to the [[​]{.icon}Trac Users Mailing
    List](http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users){.ext-link}
-   in the Trac ticket system, using either a [[​]{.icon}full
    search](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/search%3A%3Fq%3D%26ticket%3Don%26wiki%3Don "search:?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on in Trac project trac"){.ext-link}
    or a [[​]{.icon}ticket
    query](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/query%3A "query: in Trac project trac"){.ext-link}.

Please **don't** create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org for asking a
support question about Trac. Only use it when you face a *real* and
*new* bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the
[[​]{.icon}NewTicketGuidelines](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/NewTicketGuidelines "NewTicketGuidelines in Trac project trac"){.ext-link}.
The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those
guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or
implemented promptly!
