Highlights
----------

-  The distribution tarball was fixed to include a missing file, which
   prevented "make rpms" from running correctly.
-  Handle gracefully the situation where the namingContext is
   zero-length, such as when connected to the Novell eDirectory server.
-  A new option default\_domain\_suffix was added. This option is mainly
   useful for environments whose users come from a trusted domain so
   that the user doesn't have to specify that trusted domain with every
   user lookup.
-  Many man page fixes that were held from the 1.9.0 release during the
   string freeze
-  The entries in the generated known\_hosts file are now expired
   preventing the file from growing indefinitely
-  The PID file is now created after all the SSSD services start up to
   avoid notifying the user via the init system before SSSD is able to
   handle requests.
