Highlights
----------

-  This releases merges the enhacements that were included in 1.11.6 and
   stabilizes the strings before releasing 1.12.0. With this beta2, SSSD
   enters a string freeze period before the final 1.12.0 release
-  Several patches that improve portability of SSSD, especially with
   consideration of BSD systems have been included
-  The sss\_usermod tool was enhanced to add or modify custom attributes
   for entries in domains configured with ``id_provider=local``. This
   feature is mostly useful for testing the InfoPipe responder without
   having to configure a remote server.
-  Fixed unit tests on big-endian architectures

Documentation Changes
---------------------

-  A new option ldap\_use\_tokengroups was added. Setting this option to
   False disables the support for tokenGroups, which is useful for
   environments that wish to restrict the group nesting level. Doing so
   with tokenGroups enabled is nontrivial since the tokenGroups
   attribute flattens the group memberships.
-  A new option homedir\_substring makes it possible to substitute a
   templatized home directory attribute for a client-side defined value
