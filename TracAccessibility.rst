Accessibility Support in Trac
=============================

Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing
device. Some users rely on keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input
to navigate links, activate form controls, etc. In Trac, we work to
assure users may interact with devices other than a pointing device.

The keyboard shortcuts must be enabled for a session through the
`Keyboard Shortcuts <https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/prefs/keybindings>`__
preferences panel.

Trac supports accessibility keys for the most common operations.

-  on Linux platforms, press any of the keys listed below in combination
   with the ``<Alt>`` key
-  on a Mac, use the ``<ctrl>`` key instead
-  on Windows, you need to hit ``<Shift> + <Alt> + <Key>``. This works
   for most browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer)
