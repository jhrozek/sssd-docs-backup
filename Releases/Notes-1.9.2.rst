Highlights
----------

-  Users or groups from trusted domains can be retrieved by UID or GID
   as well
-  Several fixes that mitigate file descriptor leak during logins
-  SSH host keys are also removed from the cache after being removed
   from the server
-  Fix intermittent crash in responders if the responder was shutting
   down while requests were still pending
-  Catch an error condition that might have caused a tight loop in the
   sssd\_nss process while refreshing expired enumeration request
-  Fixed memory hierarchy of subdomains discovery requests that caused
   use-after-free access bugs
-  The krb5\_child and ldap\_child processes can print libkrb5 tracing
   information in the debug logs
