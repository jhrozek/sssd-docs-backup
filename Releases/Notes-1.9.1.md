Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   The distribution tarball was fixed to include a missing file, which
    prevented "make rpms" from running correctly.
-   Handle gracefully the situation where the namingContext is
    zero-length, such as when connected to the Novell eDirectory server.
-   A new option default\_domain\_suffix was added. This option is
    mainly useful for environments whose users come from a trusted
    domain so that the user doesn't have to specify that trusted domain
    with every user lookup.
-   Many man page fixes that were held from the 1.9.0 release during the
    string freeze
-   The entries in the generated known\_hosts file are now expired
    preventing the file from growing indefinitely
-   The PID file is now created after all the SSSD services start up to
    avoid notifying the user via the init system before SSSD is able to
    handle requests.
