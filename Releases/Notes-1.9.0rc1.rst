Highlights
----------

-  This is a bugfix release. No new features have been added. The most
   important bugs fixed include:
-  Potential crash when one of two parallel requests would expire the
   list of servers resolved from a SRV query
-  Fixed a crash that occured when a service was requested by both name
   and protocol
-  A sudo rules refresh is only scheduled when the sudo service is
   actually configured.
-  The evaluation of default SELinux rules was changed to match the IPA
   server expectations
