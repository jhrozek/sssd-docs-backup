Highlights
----------

-  One serious security issue was resolved related to the kerberos
   provider.

   -  Users who authenticate against Kerberos and have cached
      credentials could log in with a zero-length password
   -  The network exposure of this bug was limited, as users logged in
      this way would not have valid network credentials (by lucky
      accident).
   -  This issue was present only in the 0.99.x preview releases and not
      in any of the stable releases (0.7.1 and earlier)

-  Stability fixes since the 0.99.1 preview release
-  Added or updated several translations
-  Fixed long-standing "I have no name!" issue with X-based terminals
-  SSSD now passes "make distcheck" cleanly
-  SSSD PAM now conforms better to standards regarding
   PAM\_PRELIM\_CHECK
