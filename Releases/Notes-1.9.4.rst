Highlights
----------

-  This release focused mainly on fixing regressions compared to the 1.8
   series and bugfixes for features introduced in the 1.9 release cycle.
   The release also includes two security fixes
-  A security bug assigned CVE-2013-0219 was fixed - TOCTOU race
   conditions when creating or removing home directories for users in
   local domain
-  A security bug assigned CVE-2013-0220 was fixed - out-of-bounds reads
   in autofs and ssh responder
-  The sssd\_pam responder processes pending requests after reconnect
-  A serious memory leak in the NSS responder was fixed
-  Requests that were processing group entries with DNs pointing out of
   any configured search bases were not terminated correctly, causing
   long timeouts
-  Kerberos tickets are correctly renewed even after SSSD daemon restart
-  The autofs LDAP provider correctly updates entries that changed mount
   options on the LDAP server
-  Secondary groups are now reported correctly for a user coming from a
   trusted Active Directory server
-  Kerberos principal selection was fixed to behave correctly when
   accessing an Active Directory server
-  Multiple fixes related to SUDO integration, in particular fixing
   functionality when the sssd back end process was changing its
   online/offline status
-  The pwd\_exp\_warning option was fixed to function as documented in
   the manual page
