Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   This is mostly a bug fixing release with only minor enhancements
    visible to the end user
-   Contains many fixes and enhancements related to the ID views
    functionality of FreeIPA servers
-   Several fixes related to retrieving AD group membership in an IPA-AD
    trust scenario
-   Fixes a bug where the GPO access control previously didn't work at
    all if debugging was enabled in smb.conf.
-   SSSD can now be pinned to a particular AD site instead of
    autodiscovering the site
-   A regression that caused setting the SELinux context for IPA users
    to fail, was fixed
-   Fixed a potential crash caused by a double-free error when an SSSD
    service was killed by the monitor process

Packaging Changes {#PackagingChanges}
-----------------

-   Several patches that allow building the Python code in SSSD with
    python3 were merged

Documentation Changes {#DocumentationChanges}
---------------------

-   A new option `ad_site` was added. When this option is set, SSSD will
    attempt to connect to DCs from this particular AD site instead of
    looking up the site via DNS
-   The `ad_gpo_map_permit` option now also includes the `systemd-user`
    service to avoid errors in processing of the PAM session stack
