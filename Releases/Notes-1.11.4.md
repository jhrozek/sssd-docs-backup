Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   This release focuses primarily on bug fixes, especially for use
    cases where SSSD is acting as an Active Directory client
-   The simple access provider supports specifying users and groups
    using their NetBIOS domain name (such as `DOMAIN\username`)
-   Support for enumerating users and groups from trusted AD domains was
    added to the AD provider
-   The Active Directory site discovery was made more robust for
    configurations which use multiple trusted domains
-   Several bugs in the LDAP provider that affected setups which mapped
    Windows SIDs to POSIX IDs were fixed
-   The SSSD is now able to use One Time Password (OTP) authentication
    configured on an IPA server. Please note that this functionality is
    not present in the released FreeIPA versions yet

Documentation Changes {#DocumentationChanges}
---------------------

-   The `krb5_use_fast` option changes its default from `never` to `try`
    in the IPA provider. The config option value did not change in the
    other providers.
