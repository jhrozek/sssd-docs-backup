Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   This is a bugfix release. No new features have been added. The most
    important bugs fixed include:
-   Fixed security bug CVE-2012-3462 - HBAC rules were ignored when the
    SELinux login context support was enabled
-   Mutexes in the nss\_sss module are now released correctly if one
    thread in a multithreaded application is cancelled while the mutex
    is locked
-   The fail over code works correctly when the IPA provider is not able
    to establish a GSSAPI-encrypted connection to an IPA server
-   The SSSD correctly accepts -1 as a valid value of the shadow
    attributes
-   When the SSSD is unable to resolve a host name, it tries the next
    configured server now instead of going offline
-   The default SELinux login context for IPA users was changed to
    unconfined\_t when there are no rules on the server
-   A file descriptor leak in cases the SSSD was unable to establish SSL
    connection to an LDAP server was fixed

Packaging Changes {#PackagingChanges}
-----------------

-   A new Python wrapper around the murmur hash library has been
    introduced. It is only useful to the FreeIPA server at the moment.
