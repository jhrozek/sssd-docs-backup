Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   Several more regressions caused by cache refactoring to use
    qualified names internally were fixed, including a regression that
    prevented the `krb5_map_user` option from working correctly.
-   A regression when logging in with a smart card using the GDM login
    manager was fixed
-   SSSD now removes the internal timestamp on startup cache when the
    persistent cache is removed. This enables admins to follow their
    existing workflow of just removing the persistent cache and start
    from a fresh slate
-   Several fixes to the sssd-secrets responder are present in this
    release
-   A bug in the autofs responder that prevented automounter maps from
    being returned when sssd\_be was offline was fixed
-   A similar bug in the NSS responder that prevented netgroups from
    being returned when sssd\_be was offline was fixed
-   Disabling the netlink integration can now be done with a new option
    `disable_netlink`. Previously, the netlink integration could be
    disabled with a sssd command line switch, which is being deprecated
    in this release.
-   The internal watchdog no longer kills sssd processes in case time
    shifts during sssd runtime
-   The fail over code is able to cope with concurrent SRV resolution
    requests better in this release
-   The proxy provider gained a new option `proxy_max_children` that
    allows the administrator to control the maximum number of child
    helper processes that authenticate users with `auth_provider=proxy`
-   The InfoPipe D-Bus responder exports the UUIDs of user and group
    objects through a uniqueID property

Packaging Changes {#PackagingChanges}
-----------------

-   The private pipe directory permissions were changed from 0700
    to 0750. The restrictive permissions we causing SELinux
    `dac_override` denials
-   The Python packages for python2 were renamed from python-package to
    python2-package with backwards-compatible Provides and Obsoletes
-   The sssd-common subpackage contains a new manual page
    `sssd-secrets(5)`
-   The sssd-tools subpackage explicitly Requires `/sbin/service` on
    platforms that don't support systemd in order to be able to restart
    sssd from the `sssctl` tool

Documentation Changes {#DocumentationChanges}
---------------------

-   The `kill_service` option that was no longer useful after we moved
    from in-process pings to watchdog was removed
-   The `--disable-netlink` `sssd(8)` command-line option was removed in
    favor of `[sssd]` section option `disable_netlink`
-   The `proxy_max_children` option was added. Please see the highlights
    section for more details.
-   The `sssd-secrets` responder gained a man page in this release.
-   Two new options `containers_nest_level` and `max_secrets` options
    were added to the `sssd-secrets` responder. The former allows the
    administrator to configure the maximum nesting level of secrets
    containers, the latter allows the administrator to configure the
    maximum number of secrets that can be stored. Please note that both
    option apply to the local secrets provider only.
-   The `sssd-ldap` man page didn't specify different default for user
    and group name LDAP attribute default for the AD provider. This
    documentation bug was fixed.
