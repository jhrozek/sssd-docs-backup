Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   This pre-release does not bring substantial changes visible to the
    end-user. It is intended to be part of the development of FreeIPA
    3.3 and its focus of supporting legacy (non-SSSD) clients in a setup
    where IPA server established a trust relationship with an Active
    Directory clients.
-   Includes several fixes related to setup where the SSSD is running on
    IPA client in a special "server mode".
-   The default DNS timeouts have been tweaked in order to allow the
    c-ares resolver to cycle through all available name servers
-   The pysss module now contains a new method `getgroupslist` that
    provides a Python interface to the POSIX `getgroupslist(3)` call
-   The sss\_debuglevel tool is now able to change debug level of all
    responders, including PAC or autofs

Documentation Changes {#DocumentationChanges}
---------------------

-   The `dns_resolver_timeout` option default value was changed from 5
    to 6 seconds. At the same time, the timeout that controls how long
    the internal resolver communicates with a single DNS server was
    changed to 2 seconds. This change would allow the resolver to cycle
    through up to 3 nameservers until the `dns_resolver_timeout` fires.
-   the `sss_cache` utility gained a new option `-E`. This option is a
    shortcut to tell `sss_cache` to invalidate all entries in the cache.
    Please note that invalidating sudo rules is still not implemented as
    it requires cooperation with the back end as well.
