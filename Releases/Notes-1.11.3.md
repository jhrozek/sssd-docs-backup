Highlights {#Highlights}
----------

-   This release mostly focuses on bug fixes, especially in the AD
    provider
-   The AD provider is able to resolve group memberships for groups with
    Global and Universal scope
-   The initgroups (get groups for user) operation for users from
    trusted AD domains was made more reliable by reading the required
    tokenGroups attribute from LDAP instead of Global Catalog
-   A new option `ad_enable_gc` was added to the AD provider. This
    option allows the administrator to force SSSD to talk to LDAP port
    only and never try the Global Catalog
-   The AD provider is now able to leverage the tokenGroups attribute
    even when POSIX attributes are used, providing better performance
    during logins.
-   A memory leak in the NSS responder that affected long-lived clients
    that requested netgroup data was fixed

Documentation Changes {#DocumentationChanges}
---------------------

-   A new option `ldap_group_type` was added to LDAP, IPA and AD
    providers
-   A new option `ad_enable_gc` was added to the AD provider
