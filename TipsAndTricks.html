You probably already know all about how the System Security Services Daemon can make your offline life easier by enabling cached-credential login to your system while you don’t have access to the central authentication servers.
</p>
<p>
What you might not know, however, is that when using SSSD to perform Kerberos auth, it’s also possible to configure it to automatically acquire your network credentials when you go online. By setting the ‘krb5_store_password_if_offline’ option to ‘True’ in the [domain/DOMAINNAME] sections of sssd.conf, you can configure SSSD to store a user’s password when they log in while offline (for example, working from home). Then later, if access to the network KDC is restored (for example, connecting to the VPN), SSSD will perform a kinit on your behalf to automatically acquire a TGT for single-sign-on with your network resources.
</p>
<p>
Now, some of you will be saying to yourselves: “Wait, doesn’t this mean that my password is being stored on the system in a readable way?”. This is true but not the whole story. Yes, the password is stored on the system in such a way that SSSD (and theoretically the root user on the system, with some effort) can read the password. Without doing so, there would be no way for us to acquire the ticket granting ticket on your behalf. However, we do store the password in the most secure way possible: in the kernel keyring. This makes it very difficult for root to gain access to this password and essentially impossible for any non-root process. The risk factor is not zero, which explains why this is an optional feature, disabled by default. However, in the common laptop case (where it’s assumed that the owner of the laptop is likely to be its only user), this security/convenience trade-off is probably worthwhile.

<p>
The second advanced Kerberos feature I’d like to discuss today is automatic ticket renewal. User processes sometimes need access to the user’s Kerberos credentials, even when the user is no longer logged in. An example might be a regular cron job that the user wants to run every day a few hours after leaving work. With traditional Kerberos configurations, this user would be forced to remember to manually renew his Kerberos credentials before leaving for the day, to ensure that the expiration time on his TGT did not expire before his cron job completed.
</p>
<p>
With SSSD 1.5.0 and later, it can be configured to automatically renew Kerberos tickets for the full renewable life of the TGT. This is different from the automatic TGT acquisition above, as we do not need to store the user’s Kerberos password to accomplish this. It does require some additional configuration on the KDC server, however.
</p>
<p>
If the KDC permits users to request “renewable” TGT tickets, then what it is allowing the user to do is to use their current TGT in place of their password in order to acquire an updated TGT (with a later expiration).
</p>
<p>
SSSD 1.5.0 and later can set two options to enable it to automatically renew the user’s TGT for as long as the KDC permits.
</p>
<p>
The first option is krb5_renewable_lifetime. When set, it specifies the maximum renewable duration that the SSSD will attempt to request from the KDC. Note that this is only a request, and the KDC itself may choose to return a much shorter duration, or disallow renewals entirely.
</p>
<p>
Assuming that a renewable ticket was granted, the second option is krb5_renew_interval. This option specifies how often the SSSD should poll to see if any of the user TGTs have gone beyond 50% of their current lifetime. If they have, SSSD will perform a TGT renewal on the user’s behalf, extending the lifetime of the TGT.
