<p>
Existing wiki pages can be completely deleted using the <em>Delete Page</em> or the <em>Delete this Version</em> buttons at the bottom of the wiki page. These buttons are only visible for users with <tt>WIKI_DELETE</tt> permissions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Deleting a wiki page is an irreversible operation.
</p>
<p>
If you want to delete a page because you actually re-created a new page with the same content but a different name, it is recommended to keep the page and use it as a redirection page instead of completely deleting it, as to not frustrate the visitor with broken links when coming to the site from a search engine. 
</p>
<p>
In this situation, chances are that you actually wanted to <a class="wiki" href="https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/WikiNewPage.html#renaming">rename</a> the page instead of doing a copy + delete. 
The <em>Rename</em> operation also offers you the possibility to create a redirection page.
A redirection page is a short page that  contains a link such as  “See SomeOtherPage”. 
</p>
<p>
However, deleting specific versions or even complete pages can make sense to remove spam or other abusive submissions.
