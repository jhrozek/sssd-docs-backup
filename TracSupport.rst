Trac Support
============

Like in most `​open source projects <http://www.opensource.org/>`__,
"free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself,
mainly through the `​mailing
list <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/MailingList>`__ and the
`​project wiki <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/>`__. The latter is
the authoritative source for the
`TracGuide <https://docs.pagure.org/sssd-test2/TracGuide.html>`__
(administrator and user guides for Trac).

There is also an `​IRC
channel <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/IrcChannel>`__, where people
might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions
also happen there.

Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the
appropriate searching:

-  in the project's
   `​FAQ <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/TracFaq>`__
-  in past messages to the `​Trac Users Mailing
   List <http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users>`__
-  in the Trac ticket system, using either a `​full
   search <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/search%3A%3Fq%3D%26ticket%3Don%26wiki%3Don>`__
   or a `​ticket query <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/query%3A>`__.

Please **don't** create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org for asking a
support question about Trac. Only use it when you face a *real* and
*new* bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the
`​NewTicketGuidelines <http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/NewTicketGuidelines>`__.
The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those
guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or
implemented promptly!
