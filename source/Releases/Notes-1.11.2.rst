Highlights
----------

-  A new option ad\_access\_filter was added. This option allows the
   administrator to easily configure LDAP search filter that the users
   logging in must match in order to be granted access
-  Group resolution now supports resolving group members from different
   trusted AD domains in a single forest
-  A bug that prevented a configuration file with trailing spaces to be
   loaded was fixed
-  SSSD no longer crashes if the LDAP connection is terminated while
   LDAP requests are still in progress
-  Several important bugs related to the Global Catalog support were
   fixed:

   -  SSSD now correctly falls back to LDAP lookups in case Global
      Catalog is not reachable
   -  If the AD servers were specified using the ad\_server option and
      not autodiscovered, server fail over did not work correctly with
      1.11.1

Feature removal
---------------

-  The Kerberos provider will no longer try to create public directories
   when evaluating the krb5\_ccachedir option. This is a necessary
   backwards-incompatible change, as SSSD has no way to know when a
   directory should be public and when it shouldn't without additional
   information. Moreover creating public directories is something the
   system administrator should perform, not the authentication daemon.
   The tmpfiles.d(5) facility can be used for that purpose by admins
   that need dynamic creation of public directories at system boot time.

Documentation Changes
---------------------

-  The decimal debug levels are now recommended instead of the advanced
   hexadecimal levels which are more suitable for developers
